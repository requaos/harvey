# Phase 06: Code Review Disposition

| Finding | Severity | Disposition | Source |
|---------|----------|-------------|--------|
| WR-01 | warning | fixed | 06-REVIEW-FIX.md |
| WR-02 | warning | fixed | 06-REVIEW-FIX.md |
| IN-01 | info | fixed | 06-REVIEW-FIX.md |
| IN-02 | info | fixed | 06-REVIEW-FIX.md |
| IN-03 | info | fixed | 06-REVIEW-FIX.md |
| IN-04 | info | fixed | 06-REVIEW-FIX.md |
| IN-05 | info | fixed | 06-REVIEW-FIX.md |
| IN-06 | info | fixed | 06-REVIEW-FIX.md |
| CR-01 | critical | fixed | closed by retirement 2026-11-05 — tier-donor CI leg removed per maintainer direction; the x86_64 venue is Harvey's own kernel (06-09/06-10); venue-pin step asserts the retirement (not in the current review) |
| WR-03 | warning | open | - (not in the current review) |
| WR-04 | warning | open | - (not in the current review) |
| WR-05 | warning | fixed | resolved by IN-01 fix `aed40c38d` — the dead dd trailer line it named was deleted (not in the current review) |
| WR-06 | warning | open | - (not in the current review) |
| WR-07 | warning | open | - (not in the current review) |
| WR-08 | warning | fixed | resolved by IN-05 fix `d0d186ccd` — staleness key now watches every 6l source (not in the current review) |

Dispositions: `open` (recorded, not yet triaged), `fixed`, `skipped`, `deferred`.
Set `deferred` by hand and put the reason in the Source cell; both are preserved. A `|` in the reason is kept as prose and escaped on the next run.
Re-running the gate keeps every row it can. A row the current review no longer reports is kept and its Source cell flagged, so a finding does not leave this record silently. ONE exception: when a finding id is REUSED by a different finding, the earlier decision cannot keep a row — the id is taken — and it is dropped. A RECORDED decision (anything but `open`) is named on the console when that happens; a row still at `open` is replaced silently, because `open` records no decision to lose.
