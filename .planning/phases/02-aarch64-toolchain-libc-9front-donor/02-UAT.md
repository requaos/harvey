## Current Test

number: 2
name: Review triage: CR-01 + warnings disposition
expected: |
  The Harvey aarch64 shell subset (rc, grep, ipconfig, factotum, 12 core cmds — all 7c-compiled) visibly executes on the 9front donor kernel command-by-command: echo sentinel, ls /, cat/grep/sed/wc pipelines, date, test, ps, mkdir/cp/mv/rm round-trip, ipconfig usage, factotum resident in ps, closing SUBSET-OK. Zero panic/trap/sys: note lines.
awaiting: fix run (CR-01 + WR-01..10 via gsd-code-fixer)

## Tests

### 1. D-08 subset execution log eyeball
Open `.build/9front-dist/subset-exec.log` and read the captured serial session.
expected: The Harvey aarch64 shell subset (rc, grep, ipconfig, factotum, 12 core cmds — all 7c-compiled) visibly executes on the 9front donor kernel command-by-command: echo sentinel, ls /, cat/grep/sed/wc pipelines, date, test, ps, mkdir/cp/mv/rm round-trip, ipconfig usage, factotum resident in ps, closing SUBSET-OK. Zero panic/trap/sys: note lines.
why_human: Plan 02-07 Task 2 carries an explicit human-check for the D-08 execution gate; unlike the TC-03 gate (human-approved 2026-11-01), no human approval of this log is recorded in the phase artifacts. Automated greps pass (markers + SUBSET-OK present, 0 fault lines) but the plan requires a human eyeball of the capture.
result: [pending]

### 2. Review triage: CR-01 + warnings disposition
Decide the disposition of code-review critical CR-01 (and warnings WR-01..WR-10 — all 24 findings recorded open in 02-REVIEW-DISPOSITION.md).
expected: CR-01 confirmed real by verification: build/aarch64/run-gate.sh:726-729 still asserts `test ! -e $HARVEY/aarch64`, stale since 02-06 legitimately committed aarch64/ — every rerun of the TC-03 gate now appends a PASS block to the committed gate-evidence.log and then exits 1 with a misleading "leaked" error. Does NOT falsify any phase truth (committed evidence is historically valid; sha256 matches the committed binary), but breaks run-gate.sh's README-documented idempotence and pollutes a load-bearing proof artifact on rerun. Fix is one deletion; decide fix-now vs defer-to-hygiene alongside the 10 open warnings (silent-failure paths in nsrun.sh/vm-build.sh/nix/build.sh, gdbpoke9 120s deadline vs 600–1500s budgets, drive9.py prompt-proof echo weakness, 9cc/BUILD missing set -e, etc.).
why_human: Scope decision: the phase goal is verified achieved (5/5), so this is not a blocking gap — but a confirmed critical finding on a committed artifact needs an explicit human triage call.
result: [pending]
