# Phase 10: Userspace Services + GUI Tiers + Bootfs Payload - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-11-05
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

The services and GUI tiers ride Phase 6's machinery. Tier-2 (services): the full `sys/src/cmd/ip/` tree, `ndb/` (cs+dns), `aux/listen`, `mntgen`, `exportfs`, and the `auth/` suite (~80 files) compile for aarch64 via append-only allowlist growth, and the roadmap-named set *executes functionally* on the 9front donor kernel with committed markers (USPACE-07). Tier-3 (GUI): rio, acme, sam+samterm, plumb (+ stats/winwatch/page/proof/screenlock class) compile for aarch64, and donor-kernel syscall traces for rio/acme/sam+samterm are captured measure-first — the input for any r9 kernel growth the desktop needs (USPACE-08). Tier-4 (long tail): upas, lp, games, and the remaining cmd dirs compile; fossil+venti are compile-gated and documented runtime-unverifiable this milestone (no block device in r9); gs (753 files) is included, compile-gated, fix-or-exempt, plus one headless donor render smoke (USPACE-09). Bootfs payload: `/lib/font/bit/*` (full set), a glenda-style `/usr/glenda/lib/profile`, and a `/lib/ndb/local` template are staged into bootfs with mkimage manifest assertions, so Phases 11–12 never block on payload (DESK-03).

Work happens in this repo (Harvey). r9 is untouched this phase — no r9 execution venue, no kernel growth; the GUI traces are *input* for later phases. Addresses USPACE-07, USPACE-08, USPACE-09, DESK-03.

NOT in this phase: r9 execution of tier-2/3 binaries (Phase 11 runs the auth suite on r9; Phase 12 runs the full chain — D-04); real p9sk1 handshakes, /adm/keys, ndb domain content, keyfs-as-real-service (Phase 11); `#!` exec, service=cpu bootconf, aux/listen live at boot, drawterm, rio actually starting in a session (Phase 12); host netdev modes (Phase 9); cs/dns/ndb gates on r9's /net (Phase 8 owns /net; Phase 8's gates are numeric-only); fossil/venti runtime (no block device — compile-gated only, per roadmap); ape (excluded by milestone decision); upas send/receive UAT (PITFALLS: build-only this milestone); lp's gs-dependent stages (PITFALLS exclusion); gs fonts in bootfs (GPL island — DESK-03 fonts come from `lib/font/bit` only).

## Implementation Decisions

### gs (ghostscript) disposition — the tension Phase 6 deferred here
- **D-01:** **gs is INCLUDED in the tier-4 long-tail sweep as a compile-gated member, fix-or-exempt** (roadmap criterion 3's literal reading, chosen over PITFALLS' exclude-and-document recommendation and over a timeboxed attempt). Fixes land one commit per bug class (the v1.0 atomic-sweep convention); anything exceeding the fix budget is excluded by name with a committed comment (Phase 6 D-08 pattern). Verified at discussion time: gs's mkfile needs `$objtype.h` — either `genarch` run on a matching CPU or a committed `default.$objtype.h` (tree carries `default.386.h`/`default.alpha.h`; **no `default.aarch64.h` exists — it must be authored or harvested**); the `genarch` generator is already pcc-native-guarded (06-04 generator-audit G6), so the Pitfall-2 class is pre-cleared.
- **D-02:** **gs gets a headless donor render smoke** beyond its compile marker (user choice, stronger than roadmap-literal compile-only): `gs` renders a tiny checked-in `.ps` fixture to a bitmap *file* device (no display involved) on the donor; gs's `.ps` init/lib files are staged into the guest (srv9 writable-prefix precedent). Rationale: 753 files of ported unix C are exactly the Pitfall-3 LP64-fossil habitat — compile-green would miss them, and the render smoke is the cheap net. lp's gs-dependent stages stay excluded (PITFALLS); gs's GPL fonts are never staged anywhere (MIT-licensed `lib/font/bit` is the only font source this phase touches).

### Tier gate depth + r9 venue
- **D-03:** **The named services get FUNCTIONAL donor probes** — "runs" means demonstrably works, per the project's test-delivery-not-counters ethos (Phase 7 UAT lesson). Concretely: `ndb/cs` answers a scripted lookup; `ndb/dns` resolves through cs; `exportfs` serves a guest-side 9P mount; `aux/listen` accepts a scripted connection; `mntgen` mounts; `ipconfig` configures the donor's ether and `ping` reaches the host-side srv9 leg. All ride the Phase 6 sourced-not-typed in-guest rc sweep with per-service OK/FAIL serial markers. The donor runs a full 9front userspace (ethervirtio10 + ip stack proven in Phase 2, devcap present), so functional probes are possible without any r9 dependency.
- **D-04:** **Phase 10 execution gates are DONOR-ONLY.** r9 consumes these binaries later at the natural venues: Phase 11 executes the auth suite on r9 (its core gate), Phase 12 runs the full chain. No coupling to in-flight Phase 8 (4/9 plans at discussion time) — Phase 10 stays parallel per the roadmap's depends-on-Phase-6-only. Ledgers name `venue:donor` explicitly (Phase 6 venue-honesty convention: named venues, never an unearned marker).
- **D-05:** **The auth suite compiles complete (~80 files) plus a SHALLOW execution subset on the donor**: factotum starts and answers a scripted probe, keyfs serves over a test key file, authsrv starts and listens. Real p9sk1 handshakes, `/adm/keys`, ndb domain content, and the loopback probe are Phase 11's in-guest domain on r9 — deliberately NOT duplicated on the donor (chosen over compile-only and over a full donor p9sk1 probe).
- **D-06:** **The whole `sys/src/cmd/ip/` tree joins tier-2 as compile-gated members** (telnetd, pptpd, snoopy, httpd, imap4d, dhcpd, ftpfs, …), with the roadmap-named core (ipconfig, ping) getting the functional probes; x86-hardware-only or r9-subsystem-less dirs are excluded by name with comments (the `aux/vga`/`usbd`/`disk/prep` class per PITFALLS). Chosen over splitting ip/ across tier-2/tier-4.
- **D-07:** **Tier-4 long tail is compile-gated** per the roadmap criterion: upas + lp + games + remaining cmd dirs; fossil+venti compile-gated AND documented runtime-unverifiable this milestone (no block device in r9 — the roadmap's own words); games with per-arch asm (snes/gb class) and other unmigratable dirs are excluded by name with committed comments. upas is build-only (no send/receive UAT — PITFALLS); lp is build-only with gs-dependent stages excluded.

### GUI trace venue (USPACE-08)
- **D-08:** **rio/acme/sam traces are captured against a HOST-SERVED draw mounted over 9P into the donor guest** — chosen over a donor kernel config variant (softscreen) and over drawterm-into-donor. Verified at discussion time: the 9front donor's arm64 qemu kernel config has **no draw/mouse/screen device** (`dev` section: root/cons/env/pipe/proc/mnt/srv/shr/dup/tls/cap/fs/ether/ip/uart/usb/rtc/pci/sd); `devdraw.c` exists in the donor's `port/` but is not compiled in. Decisive argument: on r9 in Phase 12, `/dev/draw` arrives as a mounted 9P device from drawterm (r9 deliberately has no framebuffer) — so a kernel-local softscreen would measure the WRONG topology (no devmnt RPCs in the trace); draw-over-9P is exactly the syscall mix r9 must grow for. Donor kernel stays pristine; the existing srv9/guestfwd channel is the transport. — **Reversibility:** costly — the trace rig, the staged fonts, and the scripted-input machinery all key off the 9P-served-draw topology; switching to kernel-local draw later means re-capturing every trace.
- **D-09:** **plan9port's `devdraw` serves `/dev/draw` on the host** (chosen over a purpose-built Rust fake-draw server in `build/harness/`, and over devdraw-primary/fake-draw-fallback). plan9port is already a host dependency; devdraw serves the full draw file tree (new/ctl/data/mouse/cursor/snarf/kbd) proven against real Plan 9 libdraw clients; zero new protocol code. Runs on cocoa on the darwin dev machine.
- **D-10:** **Traces are SCRIPTED-INTERACTION, not launch-settle-exit** — a fixed short script per program drives real interaction via input injection (rio: menu New, type into the new rc window; acme: type text, execute a command, quit; sam+samterm: type, edit, quit). Rationale: USPACE-08's own parenthetical — libthread programs exercise unmeasured kernel corners; the event loop, mouse/kbd read loops, snarf, and sustained draw traffic ARE the measurement. Chosen over the cheaper/flakier-resistant settle-only trace and over a two-stage landing.
- **D-11:** **The GUI trace leg is darwin documented-manual ONLY** (user choice — a deliberate deviation from Phase 6 D-16's everything-in-CI default for this leg, following the Phase 8 D-16 soak-override precedent): cocoa devdraw on the dev machine, the exact command documented in the phase evidence. CI carries the tier-2/3/4 compile gates and the tier-2 donor execution gates (linux legs per convention) but never the GUI trace. — **Reversibility:** reversible — a linux Xvfb CI leg can be added later if the manual discipline rots; the trace artifacts and scripts are venue-independent.
- **D-12:** **plumber gets a FUNCTIONAL headless donor probe** (the one tier-3 GUI binary that needs no draw): starts, a scripted plumb message routes to a registered port, clean shutdown. Pre-validates DESK-05's dependency before Phase 12's drawterm session discovers a broken plumber mid-desktop. The rest of tier-3 (rio, acme, sam, samterm, stats, winwatch, page, proof, screenlock) is compile-gated; rio/acme/sam+samterm additionally get the D-08 trace.

### Bootfs payload (DESK-03)
- **D-13:** **The FULL `lib/font/bit` tree stages into bootfs — all 36MB, no exclusions** (user choice over the ~3MB minimal desktop set lucm+pelm+lucidasans and over a ~9MB Latin+common set). Verified sizes at discussion time: shinonome 13MB, symbola 6MB, lucida 5MB, gb 4MB, the CJK block ~22MB total; current bootfs.paq is 4.0MB, so the initrd grows roughly 8× (paqfs compresses; r9 boots `-m ≤ 1G`). Consequence accepted by the user. Every app finds every font; no app-font exclusion bookkeeping. gs's GPL fonts are untouched by this (they are not `lib/font/bit`). — **Reversibility:** reversible — the payload manifest can be narrowed later with a manifest-comment diff; nothing downstream keys off specific fonts beyond the staged set being a superset.
- **D-14:** **`/usr/glenda/lib/profile` stages as the FULL cpu-aware glenda reference, trimmed**: `upas/fs` and `news` dropped (upas is long-tail compile-only; news has no payload), the `case terminal` path keeps its binds/tmp/font but **loses the `exec rio`** (the guest console is serial — no draw at boot; Pitfall 14/DESK-02: rio must provably NOT start at boot), and the `case cpu` path is intact (binds `/mnt/term/dev`, `font=/lib/font/bit/pelm/latin1.8.font`, `exec rio` when called from drawterm). Phase 12 consumes the profile unchanged. In-tree reference verified: `usr/glenda/lib/profile`; rio's default font is `/lib/font/bit/lucm/unicode.9.font` (`sys/src/cmd/rio/rio.c:165`), acme's is `lucidasans/euro.8.font` with lucm fallback (`sys/src/cmd/acme/acme.c:40-41`), samterm uses `$font`.
- **D-15:** **`/lib/ndb/local` is a committed TEMPLATE with placeholder tokens, substituted at bake time from `build/aarch64/netaddr.rc`** — the Phase 8 D-11 addressing seam stays the single source (Pitfall 9's no-scattered-hardcodes rule); the mkimage manifest asserts the substituted result. Chosen over a static committed slirp-values file (drift-prone) and over full generation without a template (invisible to review).

### Phase-6-filed checklist items owned by this phase (already queued — no re-litigation)
- **libmemdraw pixel-path LP64/struct-punning audit**: drawtest's stochastic memimagedraw verification mismatch + arctest's wild-pointer write in memsetl (06-05, evidence in 06-EVIDENCE.md Phase-10 checklist) — fixed here; both tests rejoin the standing sweep when green.
- **Stale mkfile test targets** (liboventi `$O.vttest`/`test:` reference absent `vttest.c`; libmemdraw `$O.test` references absent `test.c`) — this phase decides: remove the targets or restore the sources.
- **libdynld dynld.c:128** "useless or misleading comparison: ULONG < 0" (7c note) — Pitfall-3 audit item.
- **rc argv-stack residual audit**: the 06-07 Xbackq fix's residual class DID eat markers in 06-09 r9 parity runs — audit rc's pushlist/poplist balance across every op.
- **tier cmd anti-staleness decision** (06-03 open item): per-entry `mk clean` in tier loops vs committed object sweep on toolchain change vs documented operator step — decide by the first mass tier wave this phase (tier-2 IS the first mass wave since the 06-03 7l fix class).

### Carried forward (locked in roadmap/prior phases — do not re-litigate)
- Tier machinery: append-only per-tier committed data files (`build/aarch64/tiers/tier2-services.txt`, `tier3-gui.txt`, `tier4-tail.txt` shape per Phase 6 D-13); per-tier append-only marker ledgers as the only gates (D-14); mk exit status never trusted; artifact+execution markers only; a dir enters the default build only after its per-tier gate passes.
- Gate mechanics: sourced-not-typed in-guest rc sweep + serial markers (Phase 6 D-10); timing-tolerant presence assertions with TCG-generous timeouts; expect-typed interaction does not scale.
- Donor-kernel execution FIRST (USPACE-04); measure-first trace discipline (v1.0 D-14/05-03) — the GUI traces ARE this phase's measure-first deliverable.
- Bake-into-bootfs for gates (deterministic), ufs-over-tcp for iteration; the `mkimage.sh` real-init rodata guard applies to all payloads; every baked file is a manifest assertion (Pitfall: staged-supply-chain pollution).
- CI: phase6.yml-shape linux legs for compile + donor execution gates; darwin documented-manual (D-11's GUI-trace deviation is the named exception); every action 40-char-SHA pinned.
- Exclusions by name with committed comments, never silent drops (D-08); Pitfall-3 findings filed as per-dir checklists, not drive-by fixes; fix classes land one commit per class.
- `build/aarch64/out/` last-writer-wins ownership — tier builds and bakes share it; no third writer (CONCERNS.md; the mkimage real-init guard is the tripwire).
- `aarch64` naming everywhere; Plan 9 C style in Harvey (`sys/man/6/style`); NMOUNT=54 divergence ledger lives and grows (divergent syscalls wall loudly on the donor).
- Evidence consolidated in `.planning/phases/10-*/` with SHAs recorded; markers timing-tolerant (presence, never interleaving order).

### the agent's Discretion
- Exact per-tier membership order and wave decomposition within tiers 2/3/4 (planner's dependency sort; tier data files are the record).
- Functional-probe script internals per service (fixed inputs, marker vocabulary, port numbers on the donor's network leg) — the probe *semantics* are locked by D-03/D-05/D-12.
- `default.aarch64.h` authoring route for gs: hand-authored from `arm.h`/`amd64.h` patterns vs `genarch` run natively on the arm64 donor guest and harvested — planner/researcher picks; either way the header is committed and the route documented.
- GUI trace rig mechanics: how the donor guest mounts the host devdraw over the srv9/guestfwd channel, the input-injection mechanism on darwin (cliclick/osascript/devdraw-level), and trace-file format/commit layout.
- gs render-smoke fixture content and the bitmap-device choice (any file-output device; no display semantics).
- Physical layout/naming inside `build/aarch64/tiers/` + `build/aarch64/markers/` extensions and the mk filter consumption of the new tier files (Phase 6 D-13/D-14 homes).
- ndb/local template file home and placeholder token syntax (D-15's seam-substitution constraint locked).
- Bootfs staging mechanics for fonts/profile (committed staged tree vs bake-time copy — the Phase 5 adm/timezone bake-time-copy precedent is available).
- CI job topology within the phase workflow (fast compile legs vs slow donor boot legs; D-11's GUI exception noted).

### v2.0 milestone research (the phase's design source)
- `.planning/research/SUMMARY.md` §"Phase 5: USERSPACE Services + GUI Tiers + Bootfs Payload" (research numbering) — the phase sketch: tiers ride Phase-1(research) machinery, GUI compile-gated with traces landing here, payload staged so later phases never block
- `.planning/research/PITFALLS.md` — Pitfall 1 (whack-a-mole + notorious-directories table: games/upas/lp/gs/aux-vga handling), Pitfall 2 (generator host-toolchain rule), Pitfall 3 (aarch64 bug-class catalog — the tier-4/gs audit patterns), Pitfall 5 (ape exclusion), Pitfall 9 (no hardcoded 10.0.2.x — D-15's motivation), Pitfall 14 (fonts missing from bootfs; rio started in the wrong script)

- `.planning/research/ARCHITECTURE.md` — the drawterm-session namespace walk (why draw-over-9P is the faithful trace topology, D-08)

### Semantics references (in-tree)
- `sys/src/cmd/gs/mkfile` — the `$objtype.h` rule (lines ~149-170): genarch-on-matching-cpu or `default.$objtype.h`; `default.386.h`/`default.alpha.h` are the shape references; genarch pcc-native guard confirmed by 06-04 G6
- `usr/glenda/lib/profile` — the D-14 trim reference (upas/fs, news, terminal-case `exec rio -i riostart`, cpu-case binds + `exec rio` with `pelm/latin1.8.font`)
- `sys/src/cmd/rio/rio.c:162-165` — rio default font `/lib/font/bit/lucm/unicode.9.font`
- `sys/src/cmd/acme/acme.c:40-41` — acme default `lucidasans/euro.8.font` + lucm fallback
- `sys/src/cmd/samterm/` — samterm lives as a SIBLING dir (not under cmd/sam); uses `$font` from the environment
- `sys/man/8/listen`, `sys/man/8/exportfs`, `sys/man/8/cs`, `sys/man/8/dns`, `sys/man/4/keyfs`, `sys/man/8/authsrv` — the functional-probe semantics for the named services
- `lib/font/bit/` — the full 36MB DESK-03 font payload (D-13)
- `build/aarch64/netaddr.rc` — the Phase 8 D-11 addressing seam; `/lib/ndb/local` template substitution source (D-15)

### Harness + supply chain (in-tree)
- `build/aarch64/README.md` — donor-kernel harness (the tier execution venue + the 05-03 trace rig lineage the GUI traces extend), qemu-11.1.2 drift accommodations, srv9 writable-prefix mechanics (gs .ps staging, D-02)
- `build/aarch64/{subset-build.sh,subset-exec.sh,mkimage.sh,mkpaqfs-host.sh}` — the tier drivers + bake harness the tier-2/3/4 waves extend; mkimage's real-init rodata guard + manifest assertion machinery (D-13/D-15 assert here)
- `.github/workflows/phase6.yml` — the CI shape this phase extends (new sibling or extension is planner discretion; 40-char-SHA pin rule)
- `flake.nix` — unchanged this phase (no r9 pin advance: no r9 work)

### Donor facts (verified at discussion time — re-verify only if the donor pin moves)
- The 9front donor arm64 qemu kernel config (`.build/9front-donor/sys/src/9/arm64/qemu`) has NO draw/mouse/screen device — devdraw.c/devmouse.c exist in its `port/` but are not compiled in. This is D-08's premise.
- The donor guest IS a native arm64 Plan 9 system — gs's `genarch` can legally run there (D-01's header-harvest route).

## Existing Code Insights

### Reusable Assets
- Phase 6 tier machinery: `build/aarch64/tiers/` data files + `markers/` ledgers + the objtype-gated mk filters (`sys/src/mkfile.proto`, `cmd/mkfile`, container mkfiles cmd/ip, cmd/auth, cmd/auth/factotum) — tiers 2/3/4 are pure appends to this machinery
- `build/aarch64/subset-exec.sh` + the sourced in-guest rc sweep (tier1-sweep.rc shape) — the tier-2 functional probes extend it; the staged-termrc override (06-03) runs the sweep at boot without typed console interaction
- The 05-03 measure-first trace rig (born-traced arming + tagged fragments on the donor) — the GUI trace capture's direct ancestor
- `harness srv9 --writable-prefix` — guest staging for gs's .ps init/lib files and any probe fixtures (D-02)
- plan9port `devdraw` (host) — the D-09 draw server; zero new code
- `build/aarch64/netaddr.rc` — the committed addressing seam (D-15's substitution source)
- `usr/glenda/lib/profile` — the D-14 trim reference, in-tree
- `lib/font/bit/` complete — D-13 stages it wholesale; no selection machinery needed

### Established Patterns
- Execution-gated ordering (riscv64 vaporware rule): a dir enters the default build only after its per-tier gate passes — never compile-only flag-flips
- Sourced-not-typed sweeps: the donor's devcons refuses typed console reads (Egreg by design) — every in-guest gate is a sourced rc script emitting serial markers
- Venue honesty: ledgers name their venue (`venue:donor` this phase); named T1-SKIP vocabulary over unearned OKs (06-09)
- Atomic class-sweeps: Pitfall-3 bug-class fixes land one commit per class, never interleaved with bring-up commits
- Single-source-as-data: tier lists, ledgers, netaddr.rc, and now the ndb template — data files CI can diff
- Phase-owned bootfs payloads keep tier allowlists pure (Phase 7 arp.req/netblast precedent); the mkimage manifest asserts every baked file
- No-drive-by: Pitfall-3 findings become per-dir checklist entries, not opportunistic edits mid-wave

### Integration Points
- `build/aarch64/tiers/tier{2,3,4}-*.txt` + `markers/tier{2,3,4}.ledger` (new) — D-13/D-14-pattern data homes
- `sys/src/cmd/ip/mkfile`, `sys/src/cmd/auth/mkfile`, `sys/src/cmd/ndb/` — the tier-2 container mkfiles the existing filter hooks already know how to read (06-02 keep-rule: container form `cmd/ip/ipconfig`)
- `build/aarch64/subset-exec.sh` + a new tier-2 sweep rc — functional probes land here
- The donor guest's network leg (ethervirtio10 + srv9 hostfwd) — where ipconfig/ping/cs/dns probes get their addresses (from netaddr.rc's slirp leg)
- Host plan9port devdraw ↔ guest mount over the srv9/guestfwd channel — the D-08/D-09 trace topology
- `build/aarch64/mkimage.sh` — DESK-03 payload staging + manifest assertions; `build/aarch64/mkpaqfs-host.sh` — the paqfs bake
- `.github/workflows/` — the tier-2/3/4 CI legs (linux), GUI trace excluded per D-11

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- **The acceptance story, end-to-end:** tier-2/3/4 data files append (full ip/ tree, ndb, aux/listen, mntgen, exportfs, auth suite; rio/acme/sam/samterm/plumb + friends; upas/lp/games/the-rest + fossil+venti compile-gated + gs) → the mk sweep compiles each tier fresh (per-tier ledger artifact markers) → the tier-2 donor sweep runs functional probes: cs answers, dns resolves, exportfs mounts, listen accepts, mntgen serves, ipconfig configures + ping reaches the host leg, factotum/keyfs/authsrv start+respond, plumber routes a scripted message — per-service OK markers over serial, committed → the GUI trace day on the darwin dev machine: plan9port devdraw up, donor guest mounts it as /dev/draw, scripted rio/acme/sam+samterm sessions run under the trace rig, traces committed (documented-manual, D-11) → the gs long-tail leg: `default.aarch64.h` committed, gs compiles, the tiny .ps render smoke passes on the donor with staged init files → DESK-03: full 36MB fonts + trimmed cpu-aware glenda profile + substituted ndb/local baked, manifest asserts green → ledgers append `venue:donor`; CI legs green; EVIDENCE.md consolidates.
- **Watch-out:** the gs fix budget is a *valve*, not a blank check — fix-or-exempt per bug class, each exemption a committed comment; if the class count balloons, the planner stops fixing and starts exempting (D-01).
- **Watch-out:** 753-file gs + ~40-dir ip/ + 80-file auth in one phase — wave decomposition is the planner's, but per-tier gates must stay green between waves (execution-gated ordering; mid-phase instability must not red unrelated gates).
- **Watch-out:** the donor's network is the srv9/guestfwd leg — probe scripts take ALL addresses from `netaddr.rc`; a hardcoded 10.0.2.x anywhere is a Pitfall-9 red.
- **Watch-out:** devdraw-over-9P means libdraw's client side runs against a *mounted* tree — rio's startup does `/dev/draw/new` → ctl handshake; if the mount is wrong the trace measures a failure path. The trace rig must assert rio actually reached its event loop (a marker in the scripted session), not merely that syscalls occurred.
- **Watch-out:** TCG timing for the functional probes — presence-based marker assertions with generous budgets (v1.0/Phase-6 discipline); functional probes are more failure-prone under TCG than compile gates.
- **Watch-out:** the full 36MB font payload makes bootfs.paq ~8× larger — verify the paqfs bake + r9 boot memory headroom (`-m ≤ 1G`) in the DESK-03 plan's early task, not at the end.
- **Watch-out:** tier anti-staleness (06-03 open item) fires HERE — tier-2 is the first mass cmd wave since the toolchain fixes; the chosen mechanism (per-entry `mk clean` vs committed sweep vs operator step) must be decided in the first tier-2 plan, not discovered mid-wave.
- **Watch-out:** libmemdraw's drawtest/arctest faults are LP64 pixel-path bugs — the GUI tier's libdraw family compiled green in Phase 6 but is NOT proven correct; the D-08 traces will exercise libmemdraw hard. Budget the audit (Phase-6-filed checklist) before or alongside the trace capture, or the traces may record garbage pixels.
- **User overrides to honor downstream (deliberate, don't second-guess):** gs included compile-gated over PITFALLS' exclude recommendation (D-01); gs render smoke stronger than roadmap-literal compile-only (D-02); functional probes over smoke for services (D-03); scripted-interaction traces over settle-only (D-10); darwin-manual GUI trace leg over the D-16 everything-in-CI default (D-11); full 36MB fonts over curated subsets (D-13); auth shallow-subset over both compile-only and full-donor-p9sk1 (D-05).

## Deferred Ideas

- r9 execution of tier-2 services (ipconfig/ping/cs/dns over r9's /net) — Phase 8 completes /net; Phase 11/12 consume the binaries on r9 naturally (D-04)
- Real p9sk1 handshakes, `/adm/keys` bake-time domain generator, keyfs as the real key service, ndb domain content, secstore — Phase 11 (D-05's shallow subset deliberately stops short)
- `#!` exec, `service=cpu` bootconf, aux/listen live at boot on r9, drawterm flake app, rio actually starting in-session, devssl — Phase 12 (the staged profile/fonts/ndb are this phase's contribution to that)
- fossil/venti runtime verification — future milestone (needs a block device in r9, e.g. virtio-blk)
- upas send/receive UAT; lp gs-dependent stages — not this milestone (PITFALLS)
- A linux-CI Xvfb GUI trace leg — D-11 rejected for now; revisit if the darwin-manual discipline rots
- Rust harness fake-draw server — D-09 rejected (plan9port devdraw is proven); only resurface if devdraw becomes unmaintainable as a host dep
- virtio-rng, virtio-blk, virtio-9p host mount, SMP/PSCI, RTC — future milestones (carried)
- darwin host sbrk 4096KB cap (06-01 deferred) — platform fact; relevant only if a gethunk-class host gate is needed natively on darwin
