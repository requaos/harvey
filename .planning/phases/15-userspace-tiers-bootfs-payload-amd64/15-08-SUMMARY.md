    - "the 15-07 mkpaqfs silent-drop hazard closes per-bake with a whole-staged-tree per-file cap assert (blocksize^2/4 at the default), never by trusting the warn"

key-decisions:
  - "The payload section is DECLARE-by-invocation and the SERVICES contract declares it: the must-have phrase 'rides every mkimage contract' is implemented as every contract BEING ABLE to declare it (one shared function + one manifest); growing the marker/chain/tier/net images too would have changed four proven gate images with no re-gate demanded by any plan — the services image is the one Phases 18/19 consume and the one whose gate this plan re-runs"
  - "r9's module stash moves 8 -> 64 MiB (the same 8x step the kernel heap took in 15-03): the EARLY check's first boot panicked in the stash-length reconciliation (the 8 MiB clamp on the 26.5MB module — the kernel's own panic text says 'grow the stash'); venue -m was never the limit, so the plan's 'bump venue memory' fallback was inapplicable and trimming fonts is prohibited — the D-01 fix-in-phase doctrine governs, full battery + FOD re-wire + push-before-pin held"
  - "The terminal case's plumber/'#m/mousectl' lines are DROPPED, not guarded: no devmouse or plumber substrate exists on the serial image, a failed redirect RAISES in rc (the 15-02 dialect), and a guard would need /bin/test on every image that might read the profile; a future draw-terminal venue re-derives its own bring-up"
  - "The ndb template is the flat 15-02 baked-entry shape (ip=/dom=/sys= host tuple + mask/gw attribute tuples), NOT an ipnet= block: the netaddr seam provides guest/mask/gw only (no network-address key), the plan names exactly three tokens, and Phase 18's generator composes the ipnet/authdom layer when it owns it"
  - "The manifest asserts a staged==source font file-count EQUALITY in addition to the committed floors: the floors are the reviewable lower bound, the equality makes a partial copy impossible even after the tree grows past them (T-15-19 closed beyond the plan's letter)"
  - "The witness re-pin order is driver-THEN-pin: the tier driver's output for rc/grep/awk proved tree-history-sensitive (one differing first run, then byte-stable), so build-9k10t1.sh must harvest a converged tree — the measured sequence and the open root cause are the phase deferred items"
patterns-established:
  - "Bake-time payload manifests: plain-data blocks consumed by name, with each fail class proven by a doctored-input control against the real code"
  - "Prohibition verification: a 'MUST NOT' is only verified by making the bake fail on the forbidden thing (the rio-in-terminal-case, the leaked literal, the leftover token, the trimmed tree — each control-verified)"

# Phase 15 Plan 8: Userspace Tiers + Bootfs Payload (amd64) — DESK-03 Payload + Evidence Bundle Summary

**The DESK-03 payload staged in the services image behind a committed plain-data manifest with bite-proven asserts — the whole 4303-file font tree as a bake-time copy, the seam-substituted ndb template, the terminal-rio-free cpu-aware profile — with the headroom checked EARLY (the check bit: r9's 8 MiB module stash clamped the 26.5MB paq; fixed 8→64 MiB under D-01, full battery + FOD re-wire + push-before-pin) and Phase 15 closed with 15-EVIDENCE.md consolidating all four requirement truths over re-verified captures.**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 77 min (18:17Z → 19:34Z; ~5 full gate boots inside — the EARLY check's panic + three greens + the final re-green — plus the r9 battery and the FOD two-derivation proof)
- **Started:** 2026-11-10T18:17:15Z
- **Completed:** 2026-11-10T19:34:17Z
- **Tasks:** 3/3 (Task 1 tracer)
- **Files:** 13 harvey-side (7 created incl. 6 evidence captures, 6 modified) + 2 r9 commits

## Accomplishments

- **The EARLY check was the plan's sequencing rule and it paid for itself (Task 1, tracer):** the first font-carrying bake measured the paq at 26,484,599 bytes (fonts deflate to ~18.8MB — the A3 "~≤15MB" assumption falsified, consistent with 15-05's draw measurement) and the FIRST boot panicked — r9's module stash clamped the module at 8 MiB and the stash-length reconciliation killed the boot. Root-caused at the r9 source in one step (the kernel's own panic text names the fix), fixed under D-01 with the full discipline, and the image boots green: the full payload stashed at 0x6800000, paqfs mounting 26.5MB, kernel at 104 MiB of 1 GiB.
- **The manifest has teeth (D-15):** six doctored-input negative controls — file floor, byte floor, an absent named font, an absent path, an empty file, a trimmed 3-file font source — each fail `stage_payload` at their named assert against the real extracted function bodies; beyond the plan's letter, a staged==source count equality makes a partial copy impossible even after the tree grows past the committed floors.
- **Every prohibition mechanically verified (Task 2):** a planted `exec rio` in the terminal case, a cpu case missing its rio or its font, an unknown token, a missing token, and a leaked venue literal each fail the bake (the literal via the pre-existing 10b seam grep); the substituted /lib/ndb/local reads exactly the seam's values; the profile header deliberately names neither dropped service so the whole-file grep stays clean (the 14-09 comment-prose lesson).
- **The evidence bundle is honest to its captures (Task 3):** all 23 cited evidence paths mechanically resolve; every marker claim was re-grepped at consolidation; the two places where the wire does not carry what a careless read would claim (the scoping-proof log holds evaluations, not verdicts; TRACE-GATE-PASS is a driver-console verdict) are stated at their citations; the tier-1 ledger's two stale SKIP rows are flagged as a stale record, not claimed green.
- **The phase close re-greens everything the pin advance touched:** services (final re-green), tier-1 (38 T1-OK, zero SKIP), net-smoke, and smoke all re-run at `af52fee` with captures retained — plus the r9 battery (q35exec/q35shell/q35/q35net/aarch64 virt), port 101/101, and the FOD verified green at the clean committed rev. No gate is claimed at the close on bytes it did not boot.

## Task Commits

1. **Task 0 (the D-01 kernel half): the r9 pin advance** — harvey `eba6b07e2` (fix: lock-only) over r9 `236d5a7` (the stash raise) + `af52fee` (the FOD re-wire), both pushed before the pin
2. **Task 1 (tracer): the manifest + the font-carrying bake + the EARLY check** — `bdc1fcf07` (feat)
3. **Task 2: the ndb template + the D-17 profile + full manifest green** — `07649114f` (feat)
4. **Task 3: 15-EVIDENCE.md + the phase-close re-green record** — `0a01ac695` (docs)

**Plan metadata:** this SUMMARY commit (docs)

## Files Created/Modified

- `build/x86_64/bootfs-payload.txt` — the committed DESK-03 manifest ([paths]/[fonts]/[floors], consumed by name)
- `build/x86_64/mkimage.sh` — section P (stage_payload: font copy, count equality, manifest asserts, ndb substitution, profile-shape asserts) + the 11e2 declaration + the 11r per-file cap assert + the header contract
- `build/x86_64/root-tree/lib/ndb/local.template` — the D-16 token template (zero literals)
- `build/x86_64/root-tree/usr/glenda/lib/profile` — the D-17 trim (3-line skeleton replaced)
- `flake.lock` — the r9 pin at af52fee (lock-only)
- `../r9` — x86_64/src/{main.rs,l.S} (the stash), flake.nix (the FOD hash + provenance)
- `evidence/15-08-*` — six retained captures (the EARLY check, the final re-green, the three phase-close re-runs, the EARLY driver console)
- `15-EVIDENCE.md` + `deferred-items.md` — the phase bundle + four new deferred items

## Decisions Made

See key-decisions in the frontmatter. The load-bearing ones: the declare-by-invocation reading of "every mkimage contract", the 8x stash step under D-01 (with the dispatch's "harvey repo only" framing superseded by the surfaced gap — flagged to the orchestrator below), drop-not-guard for the terminal case's input lines, the flat ndb template shape (three named tokens, no ipnet layer), the count-equality addition, and the driver-then-pin witness order.

## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed Issues

**1. [Rule 3 - Blocking → D-01] r9's module stash clamped the font-carrying paq — a cross-repo kernel fix this plan's dispatch scoped out**
- **Found during:** Task 1 (the EARLY check's first boot)
- **Issue:** the services paq grew 7.6MB → 26.5MB and r9's 8 MiB MODSTASHMAX clamped the mb2 module in early boot; the stash-length reconciliation panicked before the console stage. The dispatch context said "harvey repo only (no r9 work in this plan)" — but the plan's own fallback ("bump venue memory") is inapplicable to a fixed .bss cap, trimming fonts is prohibited (D-14), and CONTEXT.md's locked D-01 decision ("fix everything in-phase… push-before-pin, FOD re-wire-then-pin; deliberate user override") governs exactly this class — 15-03 executed the analogous heap raise autonomously.
- **Fix:** r9 `236d5a7` (stash 8→64 MiB, both constants + rationale, struct init names the const) with the full battery green; r9 `af52fee` (the FOD re-wire per the two-derivation discipline: desk03-proof-a/-b byte-identical, NAR hash three-way-agreed with the FOD's own got-value); both pushed; harvey `eba6b07e2` lock-only pin. The 8× step, the cost note (64 MiB allocatable on every venue, all x64 configs -m 1024M+), and the era rationale are committed beside the constants.
- **Files modified:** ../r9 x86_64/src/{main.rs,l.S}, ../r9 flake.nix, harvey flake.lock
- **Verification:** the battery (q35exec/q35shell/q35/q35net/aarch64 virt PASS, port 101/101, check + clippy); nix build .#boot-iso + --rebuild green at the clean committed rev; the font-carrying image boots green — ALL STAGES PASS, the module line shows the full 26.5MB stashed.
- **Committed in:** r9 236d5a7 + af52fee, harvey eba6b07e2

**2. [Rule 3 - Blocking] The tier witness red on the session's first tier build — and my first remediation was wrong-ordered**
- **Found during:** Task 1 (the first gate launch)
- **Issue:** mkimage 9a red the bake: rc/grep/awk drifted from the pinned witness digests. The drift was caused by THIS session's first tier build (the gate's own step 1) — its output for exactly those three (the tier-1 directory entries with yacc grammars) differed from every later build, which reproduce the pinned digests byte-for-byte. My first remediation re-pinned the manifest from those one-off bytes and the next gate run re-reded.
- **Fix:** the working order — run the tier driver to convergence, then re-pin via build/mm/build-9k10t1.sh (which also rebuilt the donor embed). No tracked harvey file changed (the witness manifest is untracked .build state); the root cause is undetermined and recorded as the phase deferred item with the measured sequence.
- **Files modified:** none committed (build-tree state; the donor kernel rebuilt by its own script)
- **Verification:** witness 0/38 drift; four subsequent gate runs (each with a fresh tier build) all passed 9a; the tier-1 gate green at the close.
- **Committed in:** n/a (state remediation; the finding is in deferred-items.md)

**3. [Plan-wording interpretation] "rides every mkimage contract" → declare-by-invocation**
- **Found during:** Task 1 design
- **Issue:** the must-have phrase reads as all five contracts growing by ~19MB each; that would change four proven gate images with no re-gate demanded anywhere, while the plan's EARLY check, acceptance criteria, and Phase 18/19 consumers all name only the services image.
- **Fix:** `stage_payload` is the shared section any contract CAN declare; the services contract declares it. The reading is recorded here and in the evidence bundle.
- **Committed in:** bdc1fcf07

**4. [Plan-wording sequencing] The manifest's lib/ndb/local line lands with Task 2**
- **Found during:** Task 1 design
- **Issue:** Task 1's action text lists /lib/ndb/local among the manifest paths, but the path only exists in a staged tree after Task 2's substitution — a manifest listing an unstageable path fails Task 1's own bake (D-15's letter).
- **Fix:** Task 1's [paths] carries the font tree + profile (both stageable); Task 2 appends lib/ndb/local with the template. Task 1's acceptance criteria (font tree + four fonts + the floor) are met exactly; Task 2's adds the ndb/local line.
- **Committed in:** bdc1fcf07, 07649114f

**5. [Rule 2 - Missing critical] Asserts beyond the plan's letter**
- **Found during:** Tasks 1-2
- **Issue:** the floors alone let a partial copy pass once the tree grows past them; the services bake rode the mkpaqfs default blocksize with no fit check (the 15-07 hazard the dispatch brief called out); the plan offered "a grep assert in the bake OR the plan verify" for the profile shape.
- **Fix:** the staged==source count equality (closes T-15-19 beyond the floors); the whole-tree per-file cap assert at 11r (fonts max 46089 bytes — the fit holds at the default blocksize); the profile-shape asserts in the bake AND the plan verify (each fail class control-verified).
- **Files modified:** build/x86_64/mkimage.sh, build/x86_64/bootfs-payload.txt
- **Verification:** the negative-control runs; every green bake carries the assert lines.
- **Committed in:** bdc1fcf07, 07649114f

---

**Total deviations:** 5 auto-fixed (2 blocking — one crossing into r9 under the locked D-01 doctrine, one state-remediation whose first attempt failed and was corrected; 2 plan-wording interpretations recorded; 1 missing-critical assert set). **Impact on plan:** the terminal truths are met exactly — the whole tree ships untrimmed, rio provably does not start on the terminal path, the cpu path is intact, the template carries zero literals, and every assertion class is proven to bite. NOTE FOR THE ORCHESTRATOR: this plan committed and PUSHED two r9 kernel commits (requaos/r9 main, 2a31fcc..af52fee) and advanced harvey's r9 pin — beyond the dispatch's "harvey repo only" framing, per the phase's locked D-01 decision; surfaced here rather than silently absorbed.

## Authentication Gates

None.

## Known Stubs

None — no placeholder paths, no unwired data, no skipped verifications. The ndb template's mask/gw attribute tuples are real substituted data whose ipnet/authdom composition is deliberately Phase 18's layer (D-16's template is the seam skeleton); the D-17 terminal case is rio-free by design, with the bake assert as the standing proof.

## Issues Encountered

- The EARLY check's panic arrived with an EMPTY message on the wire — the gate's own panic fast-fail (`expect_before -re {panic…}`) kills qemu mid-line before the kernel's diagnosis prints. The text had to be read from the r9 source; the truncation is now a deferred item (gate-side, accurately described).
- The paq grew 38 bytes between pre-commit and post-commit bakes: isolated by re-baking at the old KERNDATE (exact old size reproduced) — a pure timestamp-value effect; same-KERNDATE determinism held at every pin (the property the contract scopes).
- My own two pre-commit slips were caught by review before any run: a section-11 comment edit that briefly dropped the hsvctcpecho documentation bullet, and a profile header that named the two dropped services in prose (which would have red the plan's own whole-file grep — the 14-09 lesson, applied).
- The evidence-bundle mechanical check caught two citation errors of mine: backtick-adjacent `evidence/` paths (unresolvable by the verify's regex) and a quoted byte count taken from the wrong run (26487078 vs the cited capture's 26487039). Both corrected; the check that caught them is the plan's own.
- I initially mis-attributed the witness drift to a 15-07-era rebuild; the mtimes placed it inside my own session (my first gate run's tier build). Corrected before any committed record stated the wrong origin — the deferred item carries the measured sequence, not the inference.

## User Setup Required

None — no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

Phase 15 is COMPLETE (9/9 plans): USPACE-07/08/09 and DESK-03 all evidenced in 15-EVIDENCE.md with the shared-ID gate releasing all four requirement IDs. READY for phase verification, then Phase 16 (parallel) and Phases 17/18. The services image now carries the DESK-03 payload Phases 18-19 consume (fonts at their literal paths, the cpu-intact profile, the seam-substituted /lib/ndb/local); the r9 pin is at af52fee with its FOD green and every r9 gate re-proven at the close. The four new deferred items (the witness's tree-history sensitivity, the stale tier1.ledger rows, the panic fast-fail truncation, the cap-assert coverage gap) are recorded for their owning plans.

## Self-Check: PASSED

- files exist: all 13 harvey-side created/modified files checked with [ -f ] at SUMMARY time — FOUND
- commits are ancestors of HEAD: eba6b07e2, bdc1fcf07, 07649114f, 0a01ac695 (4 commits, measured from the plan ledger); r9 236d5a7 + af52fee both ancestors of r9 origin/main (pushed)
- all 22 acceptance-criteria checks re-run at HEAD: PASS (Task 1 x7, Task 2 x8, Task 3 x4, prohibitions x3); plan-level verification green — the code at HEAD is byte-identical to the last code commit 07649114f (docs-only since), at which the final re-green ran
- measured: commits=4 (git rev-list --count b7334da3d..HEAD), plan_head_after=0a01ac695, tokens=11806 (chars/4 over the authored harvey+r9 diff)
