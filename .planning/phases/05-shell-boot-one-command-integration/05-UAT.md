## Current Test

number: 2
name: Optional live-interactive sanity — `nix run .#boot-r9` and type at the live % prompt
expected: |
  At the live `% ` prompt: type `echo hi`, `ls /bin`, `ps`, `exit`.
  Commands answer correctly; `exit` returns to a fresh % prompt via init's restart loop.
  NOTE: typed input has no console echo this era (documented in deferred-items.md —
  the donor's cooked-mode echo is deliberately absent; commands execute, input is
  invisible). Judge whether that is acceptable for the milestone's 'interactive
  shell' headline.
awaiting: user response

## Tests

### 1. Push harvey master to origin and observe the first hosted GH Actions run
expected: |
  `nix run .#boot-r9-smoke` exits 0 on ubuntu-latest; run log carries
  'smoke-r9: ALL STAGES PASS — boot, echo, ls/ps/cat sweep, DEL safety, restart'.
  Record the run URL in 05-EVIDENCE.md (the PENDING FIRST PUSH slot).
  Harvey is 217 commits ahead of origin — the hosted run exists only after a push.
  If the project accepts the native aarch64-linux pristine-clone substitute
  (05-13-linux-clean-clone.log, ALL STAGES PASS at dc8299575) in lieu of the hosted
  run, mark this test passed with that rationale — 05-VERIFICATION.md includes the
  override suggestion.
result: pass
resolved: "Hosted run GREEN: https://github.com/requaos/harvey/actions/runs/41825728636 (conclusion: success, headSha 68c49ebcc — carries the G-05-1 fix d758c2071). Verified via gh API; run URL recorded in 05-EVIDENCE.md. First hosted run 41750071242 failed, diagnosed (DEBUG-G-05-1.md), fixed, re-run green."

### 2. Optional live-interactive sanity: run `nix run .#boot-r9` on this host and type at the % prompt
expected: |
  At the live `% ` prompt: type `echo hi`, `ls /bin`, `ps`, `exit`.
  Commands answer correctly; `exit` returns to a fresh % prompt via init's restart loop.
  NOTE: typed input has no console echo this era (documented in deferred-items.md —
  the donor's cooked-mode echo is deliberately absent; commands execute, input is
  invisible). Judge whether that is acceptable for the milestone's 'interactive
  shell' headline.
result: [pending]

## Gaps

- gap_id: G-05-1
  truth: "`nix run .#boot-r9-smoke` exits 0 on ubuntu-latest (x86_64-linux) with the ALL STAGES PASS marker in the run log"
  status: resolved
  resolved_by: "fix commit d758c2071 (nsrun.sh /bin/rc namespace bind); hosted run 41825728636 green"
  resolved_at: 2026-11-04
  reason: "User reported: hosted run failed. DIAGNOSED (see .planning/debug/DEBUG-G-05-1.md): the streaming-log symptom (died at libString) was a GH viewer interleave artifact — the raw log shows all 13 libs green, then boot(8) aarch64 link failure: `names=\`{membername $newprereq}` → membername's #!/bin/rc shebang fails ENOENT on a fresh host (nsrun.sh never provided /bin/rc; the lima VM's undocumented manual /bin/rc masked it on darwin+aarch64-linux; Dockerfile:42 codified the convention, the nix path never replicated it). The x86_64 axis was a red herring — first fresh-host execution was the trigger. Fix committed: d758c2071 (nsrun.sh binds $PLAN9/bin/rc at /bin/rc in the namespace). Locally verified: byte-identical CI failure pre-fix in an emulated x86_64 container, full ALL STAGES PASS post-fix, aarch64 lima leg no regression. REMAINING GATE: hosted CI re-run after push (fix is local; not yet on origin)."
