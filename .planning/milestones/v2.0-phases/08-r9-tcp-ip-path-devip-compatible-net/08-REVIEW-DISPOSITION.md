# 08-REVIEW-DISPOSITION.md — per-finding disposition ledger

One row per finding in `08-REVIEW.md`. Disposition vocabulary: `open` (untriaged), `fixed`, `skipped`, `deferred`. Hand-edit the Disposition cell to triage; put the reason in Source. This ledger survives re-reviews (REVIEW.md is rewritten by `--auto`; this file is not).

Reconciled against `08-REVIEW-FIX.md` (iteration 1, scope critical_warning): 12 fixed, 1 skipped. CR-03 and WR-03 are fixed with a **requires-human-verification** flag (race/leak logic in host-unreachable paths; consumed contracts pinned, paths themselves not host-pinnable) — verify on the Phase 9 tap leg. **17-01 update (the obligation transferred to Phase 17 per the v2.1 re-key):** CR-03's half is discharged — four deterministic x86_64 sem pins landed (r9 f9088d0, the `sem_` filter 5/5, battery 64/64); WR-03's half rides 17-02's tiered leak gates (the D-02 audit + the x86_64 OOM-release ports landed at r9 3e8bcec; the gates have not run yet — the row below stays open on that leg).

| Finding | Severity | Disposition | Source |
|---------|----------|-------------|--------|
| CR-01 | critical | fixed | 08-REVIEW-FIX.md — socket lingers in the core's linger list until State::Closed (r9 bd4db36 + pin 7300113); x86_64 re-proof (17-01, D-01/D-13): host pin `devip_tests::tcp_conv_close_lingers_the_socket_until_closed` (cargo test -p port --lib, 101/101 this session) + composed gate boot-r9-net-smoke-x64 (exit 0, all stages pass) — the shared port fix proven live on x86_64 |
| CR-02 | critical | fixed | 08-REVIEW-FIX.md — oversize/unaddressable sends error immediately (r9 904af8f + pin b9d3977); x86_64 re-proof (17-01, D-01/D-13): host pins `udp_write_oversized_or_unaddressable_errors_instead_of_wedging` + `icmp_write_oversized_or_unaddressable_errors_instead_of_wedging` + `icmp6_write_oversized_errors_instead_of_wedging` (cargo test -p port --lib, 101/101) + boot-r9-net-smoke-x64 (exit 0; the udp/icmp loopback echo legs) — live on x86_64 |
| CR-03 | critical | fixed | 08-REVIEW-FIX.md — register→check→block per iteration (r9 75970f0 + pin b48e809); requires human verification; x86_64 re-proof (17-01, D-01/D-07): the obligation's host half DISCHARGED — four new deterministic x86_64 sem pins `sem_register_is_idempotent`, `sem_wake_consumes_picked_registrations_in_order`, `sem_reregistered_waiter_is_found_by_the_next_release`, `sem_wake_never_touches_other_words` (r9 f9088d0; cargo test -p x86_64 --bins --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu -- sem_ = 5/5, full battery 64/64) + boot-r9-net-smoke-x64 (exit 0); the in-kernel contention leg rides 17-02's churn profile |
| CR-04 | critical | fixed | 08-REVIEW-FIX.md — v4-mcast/limited-bcast adds absorb record-only (r9 ac6370c + pin 2017360); x86_64 re-proof (17-01, D-01/D-13): host pin `ipifc_add_v4_multicast_and_broadcast_absorb_without_panic` (cargo test -p port --lib, 101/101) + boot-r9-net-smoke-x64 (exit 0; the ipconfig static/dhcp add legs) — live on x86_64 |
| CR-05 | critical | fixed | 08-REVIEW-FIX.md — unbind orphans convs on the dying core (r9 0f602d8 + pin 42b1745); x86_64 re-proof (17-01, D-01/D-13): host pin `ipifc_unbind_orphans_convs_on_the_dying_core` (cargo test -p port --lib, 101/101) + boot-r9-net-smoke-x64 (exit 0; the two unbind stages between the ipconfig legs) — live on x86_64 |
| CR-06 | critical | fixed | 08-REVIEW-FIX.md — tcp_gc force-hangs-up stale convs, never steals in-use (r9 79517b1 + pin 27d8ec1); x86_64 re-proof (17-01, D-01/D-13): host pin `tcp_gc_hangs_up_stale_convs_but_never_steals_an_in_use_slot` (cargo test -p port --lib, 101/101) + boot-r9-net-smoke-x64 (exit 0; the tcp/7 echo + duplicate-binding conv-alloc legs) — live on x86_64 |
| CR-07 | critical | skipped | **17-07 (the phase centerpiece's honest verdict): investigated to the capture ceiling, HARDENED, NOT CURED — the row cannot honestly flip its Disposition to cured.** 17-CR07-ROOTCAUSE.md is the record: the class reproduced LIVE 3x on the uninstrumented pinned kernel (2 pre-fix r9 59d28fa + 1 post-fix r9 8f3ff11 — the stress series at the fix pin REFUTED the fix as the cure), always ~25s in the burst window, CPU reset with no trap dump (silent shutdown, triple-fault class); the narrowing matrix (30/30 green) localizes it to the FULL 8-way concurrent bulk transfer; the recorded candidates exonerated structurally; the KVM capture ceiling empirically established. What DID land: r9 d4a5d38 (the NET_WAITERS deregister counterpart — a real stale-registration defect closed, 4 deterministic devip_tests pins, port battery 124/124, x86_64 76/76, FOD re-wired 8f3ff11 two-derivation proof, Harvey pin advanced lock-only, smoke/net-smoke/churn gates green) — hardening beside the open row, never its closure. Reopener: a host-side venue that reaches the faulting context, or non-healing instrumentation; the committed boot-r9-stress-x64 instrument fires the class at will in ~25s (WINDOWS #66 carries the open row) |
| WR-01 | warning | fixed | 08-REVIEW-FIX.md — spawned udp conv writes ride the announcer's socket with per-write metadata (r9 3dec2e9 + pin 764d0d1); x86_64 re-proof (17-01, D-01/D-13): host pin `udp_spawned_conv_writes_ride_the_announcers_socket` (cargo test -p port --lib, 101/101) + boot-r9-net-smoke-x64 (exit 0; the udp echo leg rides the spawned-conv write path) — live on x86_64 |
| WR-02 | warning | fixed | 08-REVIEW-FIX.md — dataq bounded 8 datagrams / 64 KiB, drop+count past cap (r9 8cfc44f + pin 106e939); x86_64 re-proof (17-01, D-01/D-13): host pin `udp_spawned_conv_dataq_is_capped` (cargo test -p port --lib, 101/101) + boot-r9-net-smoke-x64 (exit 0; the udp echo legs) — live on x86_64 |
| WR-03 | warning | fixed | 08-REVIEW-FIX.md — RFMEM OOM unwind arms honor the free verdict (r9 9035bb2); requires human verification; x86_64 status (17-01, D-02): the carry-over audit is COMPLETE (every alloc-then-early-return path in x86_64/src/{proc,exec}.rs enumerated; four gaps ported as r9 3e8bcec, FOD re-wired 476605d) — but the deterministic leak-gate verification has NOT run: 17-02's tiered churn gates (r9-side heap_stats-bound profile + the Harvey composed /bin/cat leg) are this row's still-open verification; do not read this row as closed until those gates green |
| WR-04 | warning | fixed | 08-REVIEW-FIX.md — bind rejects an already-bound conv (r9 c6040b7 + pin 4791dc0); x86_64 re-proof (17-01, D-01/D-13): host pin `ipifc_bind_rejects_a_conv_already_bound_to_another_medium` (cargo test -p port --lib, 101/101) + boot-r9-net-smoke-x64 (exit 0; the DUPBIND-REJECTED stage asserts devip's own "interface already bound") — live on x86_64 |
| WR-05 | warning | fixed | 08-REVIEW-FIX.md — self-table entries refcounted (r9 4ee61c8 + pin 85adba5); x86_64 re-proof (17-01, D-01/D-13): host pin `ipifc_remove_keeps_shared_selftab_entries_for_surviving_lifcs` (cargo test -p port --lib, 101/101) + boot-r9-net-smoke-x64 (exit 0; the ipconfig add/remove legs) — live on x86_64 |
| WR-06 | warning | fixed | 08-REVIEW-FIX.md — recorded default routes replay into the fresh core at bind (r9 f70d98b + pin 0a4ea82); x86_64 re-proof (17-01, D-01/D-13): host pin `iproute_default_recorded_before_bind_lands_at_bind` (cargo test -p port --lib, 101/101) + boot-r9-net-smoke-x64 (exit 0; the ipconfig static leg's default-route landing) — live on x86_64 |
