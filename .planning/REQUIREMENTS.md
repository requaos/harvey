# Requirements — Harvey OS: Build Revival + r9/aarch64

**Project mode:** standard (horizontal layers — toolchain → libc → kernel → userland)
**Naming:** `aarch64` everywhere (vestigial `arm64` in-tree artifacts get renamed/quarantined)

## v1 Requirements

### Build Tail (9k amd64 green)

- [x] **BUILD-01**: `nix run .#build` from a clean checkout completes the full namespace build and produces all three 9k amd64 kernels (`k10cpu`, `k10cpuf`, `k10f`) — fix the cmd-chain aborts: `sys/src/cmd/jpg/mkfile` `oc` derivation, `4a` `rfork bind lex.c`, and any remaining failures
- [x] **BUILD-02**: Userland install completes so `/amd64/bin` carries what embedded-root kernels need (`ip/ipconfig`, `auth/factotum`, `venti/venti`) — the root cause of "don't know how to make" kernel failures
- [ ] **BUILD-03**: Vestigial `arm64` artifacts (`build_arm64` funcs, empty `arm64/` dir, `build/mkdirs` entry) renamed or quarantined to the project's `aarch64` naming before port scaffolding lands
- [ ] **BUILD-04**: KERNDATE/reproducibility policy decided and documented (timestamp vs pinned) — required before claiming clean-checkout reproducibility
- [ ] **BUILD-05**: minimega (VM orchestration, Sandia) is packaged by the flake (`packages.minimega`, `fetchFromGitHub` + `buildGoModule`, pinned tag) and a `.mm` script boots the built 9k amd64 kernel on a Linux KVM host — the smoke-test harness for Phase 1 output. Boundary: minimega is x86/KVM-centric upstream (hardcoded `qemu-system-x86`), so it manages amd64 VMs only; aarch64/r9 boots stay on plain qemu (xtask/flake apps)

### aarch64 Toolchain + libc (9front donor)

- [ ] **TC-01**: libmach learns arm64 (`7.c`, `7db.c`, `7obj.c`, setmach entry); the retired-Alpha-under-letter-7 collision in Harvey's libmach is resolved (retire or namespace)
- [ ] **TC-02**: `7a`/`7c`/`7l` vendored from 9front into `sys/src/cmd/` with BUILD scripts; build natively on darwin-aarch64 and linux-aarch64 via the existing toolchain app; 9front `cc` frontend drift reconciled (`compat.h`)
- [ ] **TC-03**: `sys/src/libc/aarch64/` imported + `9syscall` aarch64 stub generation (`case aarch64`); a 7c/7l-compiled-and-linked hello-world proves the toolchain end-to-end **before** any arch dir/mkfile scaffolding lands (riscv64 `jc/jl/ja` vaporware rule)
- [ ] **TC-04**: Build wiring completed: `aarch64/mkfile` (CC=7c O=7), `pcc.c` objtype entry, `mkfile.proto` CPUS, config `<objtype>` section literally named `aarch64`
- [ ] **TC-05**: The userland subset needed for a shell builds for aarch64: rc, ipconfig, factotum, core cmds — plus aout2uimage or equivalent packaging if the boot path needs it

### r9 Kernel (sibling repo `../r9`)

- [ ] **R9-01**: r9 gains a qemu `-M virt` aarch64 platform (alongside raspi3b/4b): kernel entry contract (ELF `-kernel` boot, DTB at 0x40000000, `-cpu cortex-a72`), memory map, GICv2, PL011 console, generic timer — proven by kernel log output in qemu
- [ ] **R9-02**: r9 process model + `svc` syscall dispatch sufficient for userland (EL0 entry/return, trap frame matching Plan 9 ureg conventions)
- [ ] **R9-03**: r9 first-process path loads and runs a Harvey aarch64 `init` (embedded root-fs or equivalent delivery), faulting in user pages
- [ ] **R9-04**: Harvey↔r9 syscall ABI contract documented and enforced by static checks (Harvey's Ar0/va_list systab ABI vs r9's Rust trap frame — cross-repo layout match verified at build time)
- [ ] **R9-05**: r9 repo carries its own `flake.nix` managing its build environment (pinned rust toolchain + `llvm-tools` for `llvm-objcopy`, qemu, cargo xtask) — devshell + apps mirroring this repo's conventions, so r9 builds reproducibly standalone

### Integration

- [ ] **INT-01**: One command (`nix run` app or `cargo xtask`) boots r9 + Harvey aarch64 userland to an interactive `/bin/rc` shell over PL011 console in qemu
- [ ] **INT-02**: Expect-style smoke test asserts the shell prompt, runnable on darwin-aarch64 and linux hosts
- [ ] **INT-03**: Reproducible-from-clean-checkout verified for both repos (documented commands, pinned toolchains)
- [ ] **INT-04**: Harvey's flake consumes r9 as a proper **flake input** (git URL with pinned rev) — no relative-path (`../r9`) or git-submodule glue between the repos

## v2 Requirements (deferred)

- virtio-9p host mount in r9 qemu-virt (collapses userland iteration time) — top v1.x candidate
- SMP via PSCI, virtio-net/blk drivers, RTC, PCIe ECAM usage
- 386 legacy kernel + ISO/dist stage
- TLS/security hardening (TLS 1.3, cipher pruning)
- Harvey on r9 for amd64 (replace 9k on the primary arch)
- Hardware aarch64 bring-up (r9 already has raspi3b/4b base)

## Out of Scope

- Harvey 9k (C kernel) aarch64 port — superseded by r9 adoption (2026-10-30)
- Go userland on aarch64 — Go unsupported on plan9/arm64
- ghostscript/full userland `mk install` on aarch64 — MMX asm breakage; prune rather than fix
- x86_64-darwin host support
