# Requirements: Harvey OS — v2.1 x86_64 Pivot + r9 Kernel Flush-Out

**Defined:** 2026-11-06
**Core Value:** Harvey userspace + r9 kernel boot to a shell on x86_64 under qemu/KVM — reproducible from clean checkouts on Linux (primary host since 2026-11-06; darwin stays a documented-manual venue).
**Milestone goal:** Re-target Harvey+r9 from aarch64 to x86_64 under qemu/KVM and use Harvey's full amd64 userspace to functionally harden ("flush out") the r9 kernel — delivering the inherited v2.0 payoff (auth, cpu/drawterm, rio) on x86_64 — as the proving ground en route to r9 becoming a complete Rust port of Harvey.

**Inheritance:** v2.0 (subsumed 2026-11-06) delivered Phases 6–8 (USPACE-01..06, NETDRV-01..04, NETIP-01..07, USPACE-10 — see `.planning/milestones/v2.0-REQUIREMENTS.md`). The 26 pending v2.0 requirements are inherited below, re-keyed to x86_64 where arch-bound.

## v2.1 Requirements

### r9 x86_64 Platform Bring-Up (X64)

- [x] **X64-01**: r9 boots on qemu x86_64 (q35-vs-pc machine decision recorded with rationale) via a recorded DTB-free boot protocol (decided against 9k's existing multiboot path or equivalent) — the Phase-3-style platform gate: banner, timer ticks, serial input echo
- [x] **X64-02**: APIC interrupt plumbing (LAPIC + IOAPIC) + HPET/PIT timers proven under load — the GICv2/GICv3 equivalent; INTx level-triggered virtio ISR read-to-ack re-proven
- [x] **X64-03**: PCI/ECAM discovery without DTB (ACPI MCFG or the fixed q35 window) with a moved-window perturbation proof — NETDRV-01's no-hardcoded-constants discipline carried to x86_64
- [x] **X64-04**: virtio-net binds on x86_64 (arch-neutral `port/` carry-over) and devether presents `/net/ether0` with the guest ARP observable on the host — the NETDRV gates re-proven
- [x] **X64-05**: r9's flake ships an x86_64 kernel package; acceptance gates run KVM-native by default with the TCG fallback documented

### Harvey amd64 Userspace on r9 (XEXEC)

- [x] **XEXEC-01**: amd64 Ureg/TrapFrame ABI contract published and build-enforced — the `aarch64/ABI.md` equivalent: offsets frozen, const asserts + xtask ureg-check with a negative control
- [x] **XEXEC-02**: Harvey amd64 binaries exec on r9 x86_64 through the real EL/syscall path (measured-set dispatch carries; staged-init + hello-equivalent proof)
- [x] **XEXEC-03**: full boot chain boot(8)→init→rc reaches the interactive `% ` prompt on x86_64 with the expect smoke gate green twice consecutively (boot-r9-smoke equivalent)
- [x] **XEXEC-04**: tier machinery re-keyed to `objtype=amd64`: tier-0 libraries + tier-1 core commands proven executing on r9-x86_64 (donor venue per Phase-6 D: Harvey's own 9k kernel, k10t1)
- [x] **XEXEC-05**: `/net` stack re-gated on x86_64: loopback ping/udp/tcp echo, static + DHCP ipconfig, and the composed net smoke all green on the new arch

### r9 Kernel Flush-Out (FLUSH)

- [ ] **FLUSH-01**: Phase-8 review CR classes closed with tests (or explicitly dispositioned with rationale): conv_close FIN-drop, permanent-send-error wedge, semacquire wakeup loss, ipifc multicast panic, unbind stale-handle aliasing, tcp_gc aliasing, multi-waiter RX-wake
- [ ] **FLUSH-02**: RFMEM OOM-path page leaks (the 6 WR findings) closed with refcount proofs
- [ ] **FLUSH-03**: Phase-7 WR hardening gaps closed: cap-walk loud-abort holes, WaitSet-16-vs-MAX_PROCS-64 sizing, used-id slot-liveness
- [ ] **FLUSH-04**: known kernel windows closed or gated: fork+exec arena drain (WINDOWS #44), namec union-create miss (WINDOWS #45) — every flush-out fix lands with a pin (host test or boot-test gate) per the established discipline

### Userspace Tiers on amd64 (USPACE — continuing v2.0 numbering, re-keyed)

- [x] **USPACE-07**: Session daemons + services compile and execute: aux/listen, mntgen, ndb/cs+dns, exportfs, ip/ suite, auth/ suite (~80 files) — on the k10t1 (9k amd64) venue, then r9-x86_64
- [x] **USPACE-08**: GUI stack compiles for amd64 (libdraw family + rio + acme + sam + plumb) and donor-kernel syscall traces for rio/acme/sam are captured (measure-first input for r9 kernel growth)
- [x] **USPACE-09**: Long tail compiles for amd64: upas + lp + remaining cmd dirs; fossil + venti compile-gated (runtime-unverifiable — no block device in r9); gs included

### r9 TCP/IP Path — exit gate (NETIP — continuing)

- [ ] **NETIP-08**: Networking exit gate: sustained bidirectional TCP flow + load soak on the **tap leg** on x86_64 (slirp forgives L2 bugs — ping on slirp is not a gate)

### Host Networking (HNET — continuing)

- [ ] **HNET-01**: slirp+hostfwd hermetic default: hostfwd bound to 127.0.0.1 for BOTH tcp/17010 and tcp/567; zero privilege; CI-able
- [ ] **HNET-02**: `--net=slirp|tap|vmnet` explicit mode selection on the boot app (no silent auto-downgrade); netdev stanza single-sourced as data in r9's x86_64 platform TOML, consumed by Harvey's flake
- [ ] **HNET-03**: linux tap/bridge leg (qemu-bridge-helper + br0) documented per-distro and tested on the primary host — the L2-truth leg
- [ ] **HNET-04**: darwin socket_vmnet leg documented as opt-in documented-manual (builtin vmnet is entitlement-walled on nixpkgs qemu)
- [x] **HNET-05**: doctor-style checker diagnosing privileged host setup, printing exact sudo/bridge/firewall remediation

### In-Guest Auth Domain (AUTH — continuing)

- [ ] **AUTH-01**: Bake-time domain generator: machine key + `/adm/keys` + nvram-substitute + ndb entries produced as ONE hash-paired unit; demo domain loudly labeled DEMO; pairing fails loud
- [ ] **AUTH-02**: r9 `/dev/random` CSPRNG for p9sk1 challenges, seeded from an x86_64-appropriate entropy source (no DTB — e.g. RDRAND/jitter mix), re-keyed from v2.0's DTB-seeded design
- [ ] **AUTH-03**: r9 devcap `#¤` (caphash/capuse) — the `auth_chuid` path the cpu server depends on
- [ ] **AUTH-04**: keyfs starts non-interactively over the baked `/adm/keys`; authsrv listens on tcp/567
- [ ] **AUTH-05**: ndb content for the guest domain (authdom, hostid, sys, ether) staged in the image
- [ ] **AUTH-06**: In-guest loopback p9sk1 probe (auth/debug) green BEFORE any drawterm attempt; non-hostowner speaksfor gate
- [ ] **AUTH-07**: Serial-visible auth logging from day one
- [ ] **AUTH-08**: secstore available for persistent key storage beyond baked keys
- [ ] **AUTH-09**: writable-`/adm` + nvram-substitute scoping decided and documented (baked+paired for CI; host-9P `/adm` mount for real use)

### CPU Service (CPU — continuing)

- [ ] **CPU-01**: r9 `#!` exec (tcp17010 is literally `#!/bin/cpu -R`, execl'd by listen)
- [ ] **CPU-02**: `service=cpu` bootconf path: plan9.ini delivered via the x86_64 boot-protocol equivalent of DTB `/chosen/bootargs` → cpurc runs instead of termrc (re-keyed)
- [ ] **CPU-03**: aux/listen + tcp17010 live at boot; exportfs served; r9 implements WSTAT/FWSTAT/REMOVE
- [ ] **CPU-04**: Full `cpu -R` remoteside flow verified end-to-end: p9any→p9sk1 → auth_chuid → client exportfs at /mnt/term → stdio from /mnt/term/dev/cons → rc -li

### Drawterm + rio Desktop (DESK — continuing)

- [ ] **DESK-01**: Flake drawterm app: provenance decision recorded; wrapper pins `-O`, scrubs `$cpu`/`$auth`/`$PASS`, prints the exact connect line
- [ ] **DESK-02**: profile `case cpu` binds /mnt/term/dev over /dev and execs rio (serial marker proves rio did NOT start at boot)
- [x] **DESK-03**: `/lib/font/bit/*` + glenda-style lib/profile + `/lib/ndb/local` template staged in bootfs with manifest assertions
- [ ] **DESK-04**: r9 devssl `#D` (rc4_256/sha1) for encrypted sessions via pushssl; `-e clear` documented fallback (stronger crypto is PROTOCOL-blocked — the hardening milestone)
- [ ] **DESK-05**: plumb/plumber runs in the drawterm session
- [ ] **DESK-06**: `-G` text-mode drawterm interop gate in CI via hostfwd (scripted login → shell marker)
- [ ] **DESK-07**: Human-accepted graphical rio leg on linux AND darwin (drawterm is host-side; the darwin leg connects to the linux-hosted guest)

### Integration (INT — continuing)

- [ ] **INT-05**: `nix run .#boot-r9` remains the ONE command on x86_64 — brings up the full system (net + auth + cpu listener); boot-r9-smoke extended to the new chain
- [ ] **INT-06**: r9 flake.lock pin advances via push-before-pin as its OWN commit + fresh hosted CI run (never bundled)
- [ ] **INT-07**: Clean-checkout proof of the full v2.1 chain on linux-x86_64 (darwin documented-manual)

## Future Requirements

Deferred to future milestones. Tracked but not in the v2.1 roadmap.

- Rust port of Harvey userspace into r9 — the north star's final track; starts only after r9 is proven/flushed under the C userspace
- aarch64 re-activation (frozen at the v2.0 pin; TCG-bootable history preserved)
- virtio-9p host mount in r9 (collapses userland iteration time)
- SMP bring-up (x86_64: INIT-SIPI-SIPI; aarch64: PSCI); RTC; virtio-blk
- virtio-gpu / framebuffer console in r9 (native graphics without drawterm)
- fossil/venti RUNTIME (needs a block device — compile-only in v2.1)
- dp9ik + rcpu + TLS 1.2/1.3 server-side (the TLS/security hardening milestone)
- Hardware targets beyond qemu

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded from v2.1. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| aarch64 as an active development target | Frozen at the v2.0 pin (2026-11-06 pivot): TCG-bootable history preserved, v2.1 phases key to x86_64 only |
| Rust port of Harvey userspace | The north star's final track, deliberately a FUTURE milestone — v2.1 exists to flush out r9 under the C userspace first |
| Harvey 9k (C kernel) aarch64 port | Superseded by r9 adoption (2026-10-30); 9k stays the amd64 standalone kernel + donor venue |
| virtio MSI-X | INTx remains the one interrupt truth this milestone; MSI-X is future hardening |
| e1000 / other NIC models | virtio-net only; one driver, one truth |
| virtio-gpu / framebuffer in r9 | The draw device arrives over 9P from drawterm — the entire point of the drawterm architecture |
| dp9ik / rcpu / TLS server-side | Different auth+session protocol stack (9front); Harvey is 4e p9sk1 — hardening milestone scope |
| slirp as a correctness target | Hermetic default + CI leg only; it forgives L2 bugs — tap is the truth leg (NETIP-08) |
| DHCPv6 / SLAAC tooling | IPv6 scoped to devip ip6 + static/ipconfig configuration |
| APE | Nothing in the v2.1 session path needs it (amd64 APE exists in-tree if ever wanted) |
