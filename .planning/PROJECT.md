# Harvey OS — Build Revival + r9 Adoption

## What This Is

Harvey OS is a Plan 9 4th Edition derivative operating system (C, mk-based build, dual kernel trees: legacy `sys/src/9/` and active amd64 `sys/src/9k/`). This project revived the dormant upstream build (last upstream commit 2022-03-30), modernized the dev environment with Nix, and proved Harvey's userspace on the **r9** kernel (sibling repo `../r9`, a Rust reimplementation of the Plan 9 kernel) on aarch64 through v2.0. At v2.1 (2026-11-06) the target pivoted to **x86_64**: Harvey's full amd64 userspace now serves to functionally flush out r9 as a kernel — en route to the north star of r9 becoming a complete Rust port of Harvey running on its own kernel, with Harvey-standalone-on-9k preserved throughout.

## Core Value

Harvey userspace + r9 kernel boot to a shell on x86_64 under qemu/KVM — reproducible from clean checkouts on Linux (primary host since 2026-11-06; darwin stays a documented-manual venue).

## Current Milestone: v2.1 x86_64 Pivot + r9 Kernel Flush-Out

**Goal:** Re-target Harvey+r9 from aarch64 to x86_64 under qemu/KVM and use Harvey's full amd64 userspace to functionally harden ("flush out") the r9 kernel — delivering the inherited v2.0 payoff (auth, cpu/drawterm, rio) on x86_64 — as the proving ground en route to r9 becoming a complete Rust port of Harvey.

**Target features:**
- r9 x86_64 platform bring-up: qemu q35/pc platform layer (boot protocol without DTB, APIC/HPET, PCI/ECAM glue into the arch-neutral `port/` virtio stack), KVM-native acceptance gates
- Harvey amd64 userspace on r9: re-derived exec/ABI contract (amd64 Ureg/TrapFrame), boot chain boot→init→rc on x86_64; tier machinery re-keyed to `objtype=amd64` (no new toolchain work — 6c/6a/6l already green)
- Kernel flush-out: the open review backlog (20 Phase-8 + 13 Phase-7 CR/WR findings) closed as real userspace load lands on the kernel
- Inherited v2.0 goals re-keyed to x86_64: host net modes (linux-native tap), services/GUI tiers + bootfs payload, in-guest p9sk1 auth, cpu service + drawterm + rio desktop

- ✓ aarch64 userspace toolchain in-repo: vendored 9front 7a/7c/7l (pinned `350266104f`, Harvey shims), libmach arm64 (Alpha excised from letter 7), libc/aarch64 + frozen syscall ABI (`aarch64/ABI.md`), `objtype=aarch64` wiring — Phase 2 (TC-01…TC-05; proven by execution: hello.7.out + 16-binary shell subset run on the 9front donor kernel under qemu TCG)
- ✓ r9 aarch64 boots on qemu `-M virt,gic-version=2`: platform tree (`platform/{raspi3b,raspi4b,virt}`), ELF `-kernel` + committed DTB at `0x40000000`, GICv2 + generic timer ticks, PL011 IRQ echo, `cargo xtask boot-test` harness, `virtpanic` debug gate — Phase 3 (SC#1–5; evidence bundle byte-identically reproducible, `03-VERIFICATION.md` 22/22)
- ✓ r9 carries its own `flake.nix` (rust-overlay honoring `rust-toolchain.toml`, qemu + dtc, `apps.build`) — Phase 3 (R9-05; darwin + linux legs both passed)
- ✓ r9 loads and runs Harvey aarch64 userland binaries: paqfs initrd delivery (loader + patched DTB), devroot, demand-paged exec, EL0 entry, SVC dispatch (measured set), preemptive round-robin, RFORK/AWAIT/EXITS, notes via devproc-lite — Phase 4 (R9-02/R9-03; SC#2 hello.7.out prints, SC#4 smoke suite green; `04-EVIDENCE.md`, r9 pinned `54e8c10`)
- ✓ Harvey↔r9 syscall ABI published + build-enforced: TrapFrame ≡ `aarch64/include/ureg.h` field-for-field (35×u64, stride 288), two-layer static checks (const asserts + xtask `ureg-check` with negative control) — Phase 4 (R9-04/SC#1; `aarch64/ABI.md` kernel-side appendix)
- ✓ **Core value delivered**: one command (`nix run .#boot-r9`) boots r9 + Harvey aarch64 userland to an interactive `/bin/rc` shell — from clean checkouts of both repos, on darwin-aarch64 and linux; `nix run .#boot-r9-smoke` expect-gates it (INT-01..04) — Phase 5 (namespace core, devenv, devpipe/devdup/devsrv, devmnt, devcons read path, devproc; smoke green on darwin ×2, native aarch64-linux pristine clone, AND hosted x86_64-linux CI run 41825728636; UAT 2/2 incl. live-prompt)
- ✓ r9 namespace/device substrate for the shell path: namec/pgrp/union walks, per-pgrp env (`#e`), pipes/fd groups, kernel 9P client (FVERSION/MOUNT), cooked console + note groups, full `/proc` — Phase 5 (D-03..D-09; host suites 75/75+, five boot profiles green)
- ✓ Note-delivery timing race root-caused and buried: `trap_return` tail clobbered restored x9 (r9 `83cbbbe`) — Phase 5 wave 0 (D-14; 20/20 virtnotes + 20/20 virtmulti ×2, DEL-safety re-exercised every smoke)
- ✓ Harness hygiene (D-16): fresh serial log per boot-test run, process-group qemu teardown — Phase 5 (05-01); WR-07 keyed survivor sweeps (05-REVIEW-FIX)
- ✓ Host harness tooling is std-only Rust (`build/harness/`, one binary + subcommands) — zero Python in the harness path — quick task 261103-giq (5/5 equivalence gates)
- ✓ r9 unsafe surface minimized + gated: static mut → 0, per-process usermem model locked, forbid(unsafe_code) across port/ except two named shims, 160-site audit reconciled — quick task 261103-p64
- ✓ r9 speaks Ethernet on qemu virt: DTB-driven PCI/ECAM discovery (zero hardcoded constants, moved-window perturbation proof), from-scratch unsafe-free virtio transport, virtio-net driver bind with ISR read-to-ack on both GIC gens, devether `#l` + netif presenting /net/ether0, guest ARP ping-pong + 256-frame TX blast reconciled against host pcaps — Phase 7 (NETDRV-01..04; `07-EVIDENCE.md`; r9 pinned `a5b1b42`; hosted CI green; UAT 2/2)
- ✓ Full-tree aarch64 userspace sweep machinery live: Wave-0 landmines closed (cc/6l gethunk hangs + FPdbleword + 6l LP64 float emission, regression repros committed), dir-coverage proof that mk DIRS reaches every cmd dir (jpg/mahjongg/4a blockers fixed), generator audit with host-toolchain proofs, tiered append-only allowlists (`tiers/*.txt` are data) with artifact+execution marker ledgers as the only gates — 22 outstanding libs compile via the mksyslib portable-C fallback, tier-1 core cmds + guest build chain execute on the donor then r9 — Phase 6 (USPACE-01..06; `06-EVIDENCE.md`; ledgers `build/aarch64/markers/`)
- ✓ v1.0 pool-panic carry-over closed WITH INFORMATION: pswt-fixed 6c boots 9k10cpu PAST the bad-magic point (PASS no-panic-signature, boot continues) — Phase 6 (USPACE-10; `evidence/poolpanic-verdict.md`; deferred 02-8 retired)
- ✓ x86_64 CI tier venue is Harvey's OWN kernel: k10t1 config (k10cpu device set verbatim) embeds the amd64 tier-1 set + sweep, boots standalone under plain qemu, green locally; phase6.yml tier-9k leg self-provisions clean runners; 9front tier-donor CI leg retired (9front stays aarch64-local donor only) — Phase 6 gap closure (G-06-1/CR-01; maintainer direction 2026-11-05; hosted run all-four-legs green)
- ✓ r9 `/net` speaks devip: the D-03/D-08 contract doc enumerates the full devip surface (man-vs-source divergences flagged) and gates assert it; smoltcp 0.14.0 supply chain pinned with provenance; the event-driven seam (no polling — BusyCell ownership, NET_DEADLINE from poll_at) host-pinned; the #I tree + conv model + loopback/null/ether media + icmp/udp/tcp/icmpv6 protos + accept pool + netlog/iproute/ipselftab landed; unmodified libc dial/announce/listen and unmodified ipconfig (static + DHCP DORA + IPv6 try/DAD/add) green in-guest; aan scripted drop-and-resume proven; bidirectional tcpblast soak machinery green on slirp with honest NOT-L2-TRUTH labels (the tap-leg truth verdict is Phase 9's per D-15) — Phase 8 (NETIP-01..07; `08-EVIDENCE.md`; r9 pinned `19f61ed`; hosted CI green ×2; `08-VERIFICATION.md` 36/36)
- ✓ r9 honors RFMEM: donor dupseg semantics (Data/Bss shared under RFMEM, Stack always fresh) incl. shared-segment GROWTH via RFMEM families + the brk_ family arm, refcount-gated frees — plus the SEMACQUIRE/SEMRELEASE semaphore pair — Phase 8 (08-04 blocking checkpoint, user decision A after Harvey-fidelity verification: ip/ping.c:572's rfork(RFPROC|RFMEM|RFFDG) is Harvey-native; ping + udp echo gates green)

### Active

Milestone v2.1 headline scope (decomposed into REQ-IDs in REQUIREMENTS.md; v2.0's delivered Phases 6–8 are recorded in Validated below):

- [ ] r9 x86_64 platform bring-up on qemu q35/pc with KVM-native acceptance gates
- [ ] Harvey amd64 userspace executes on r9: re-derived exec/ABI contract, boot→init→rc chain, tier machinery re-keyed to `objtype=amd64`
- [ ] r9 kernel flush-out: the open review backlog (Phases 7–8 CR/WR findings) closed under real userspace load
- [ ] Inherited v2.0 payoff on x86_64: host net modes, services/GUI tiers + bootfs payload, in-guest p9sk1 auth, cpu + drawterm + rio

Carried over from v1.0:

- [ ] Upstream raspi3b-on-qemu-11.1.2 boot defect (FAR 0xfe215004 — rpi4 MMIO base on the raspi3b machine) — pre-existing, A/B-proven not-a-regression, accepted 2026-11-01; phase-03 deferred-items.md #1 (aarch64-frozen with the v2.0 pin)
- [x] Fix the legacy harvey.yml workflow to build via nix (pre-dates the nix scaffolding; red streak on master since 2026-11-04T12:01Z) — Phase 6 UAT deferred follow-up, backlog 999.1 — workflow rewritten onto the nix pipeline 2026-11-05; hosted green run PENDING FIRST PUSH (261105-slx)

### Out of Scope

- 386 legacy kernel (`sys/src/9/pc`) and the ISO/dist stage — deferred; focus is 9k amd64 health first
- Hardware aarch64 targets — r9 already has raspi3b/4b; this project targets qemu virt
- Harvey 9k (C kernel) aarch64 port — superseded by the r9 adoption decision; 9k stays amd64 reference
- TLS/security modernization (TLS 1.2 cap, RC4/DES/NULL ciphers) — separate hardening milestone
- Dual `9` vs `9k` kernel-tree deduplication — rendered moot by r9 adoption
- Go-based userland on aarch64 — Go is unsupported on plan9/arm64
- Rust port of Harvey userspace into r9 — the north star's final track, deliberately a FUTURE milestone: v2.1 exists to prove and flush out r9 under the C userspace first
- aarch64 as an active development target — frozen at the v2.0 pin (2026-11-06): TCG-bootable history preserved, all v2.1 phases key to x86_64; re-derivable later if wanted

## Context

- **Kernel future is r9**: sibling repo `../r9` (Rust reimplementation of the Plan 9 kernel; cargo workspace: `port/` portable code + per-arch crates `x86_64/`, `riscv64/`, `aarch64/`; xtask build/qemu/boot-test runners). r9's aarch64 now targets raspi3b/raspi4b AND qemu `-M virt` (Phase 3: cfg-gated platform tree, committed virt-gicv2 DTB, GICv2 + generic timer + PL011 IRQ echo, `cargo xtask boot-test` acceptance harness, `virtpanic` debug config); through v2.0 it carries the full shell/net substrate on aarch64 (exec, namespace/devices, devether/devip — Phases 4–8). The `x86_64/` crate is the v2.1 bring-up target — lean today (uart16550, pio, trap, vsvm; no platform tree, no APIC/PCI glue) — while `port/` (proc/exec/syscalls, virtio transport, devip, devether) is arch-neutral and carries over whole. Harvey supplies the userspace, libc, toolchain, and dist machinery; r9 supplies the kernel. r9 has its own flake (R9-05) — commits land on `main` of the `requaos/r9` fork.
- **Upstream dormant**: Harvey-OS/harvey last commit 2022-03-30; CI was a fragile expect+qemu bootstrap on EOL Ubuntu 21.10 (`.planning/codebase/CONCERNS.md`)
- **Build system**: mk + mkfiles; host tools built by `sys/src/cmd/*/BUILD` scripts; kernel build runs in a Linux mount namespace emulating Plan 9's root layout (`sys/src/RUN_BUILD_IN_PRIVATE_NAMESPACE` → `BUILD_SETUP_NAMESPACE` → `BUILD` → `build/scripts/linux-build`)
- **Nix scaffolding**: `flake.nix` + `nix/*.sh`; on darwin the namespace build runs in a lima VM (virtiofs subdir binds yield empty trees, so the VM build rsyncs to guest-local disk and pulls `amd64/`+`386/` back)
- **Vendored 9-cc**: `sys/src/cmd/unix/9cc/` carries the `iar` subset of 0intro/9-cc with aarch64 host support (see its README)
- **aarch64 toolchain donors**: 9front (MIT) vendored at pin `350266104f` in Phase 2 — `sys/src/cmd/{7a,7c,7l}`, `sys/src/libc/aarch64/`, libmach `{7.c,7db.c,7obj.c}` (retired-Alpha letter-7 collision resolved by excision, D-04/D-05). The pinned donor tree doubles as the execution reference: it builds its own CONF=qemu kernel with Harvey's tools and boots it for the TC-03/TC-05 gates (`build/aarch64/`).
- **Naming tension**: in-tree vestiges (`build_arm64`, empty `arm64/` dir, mkdirs) use `arm64`; 9front convention is also `arm64`; project decision is `aarch64` — the toolchain phase starts by renaming/quarantining the vestiges.
- **Known upstream breakage**: `sys/src/cmd/jpg/mkfile:56-68` derives a nonexistent `oc` compiler from `cputype=unix`, aborting the cmd DIRS loop before `ip/`+`venti/` → root-embedding kernels (k10cpuf/k10f) can't find `/amd64/bin/ip/ipconfig`; `4a` `rfork bind lex.c` failure; `mahjonng` cpp breakage noted in Dockerfile TODO
- **VM orchestration**: minimega (`../minimega` read-only clone for reference; the flake fetches+builds it via `nix/minimega.nix`, pinned tag 3.3.0) manages amd64 test VMs on Linux/KVM hosts with `.mm` scripts. It is x86/KVM-centric upstream — aarch64/r9 test boots use plain qemu instead. On darwin, KVM is unavailable; minimega runs on linux hosts (or the lima guest, TCG-slow). **Now unblocked on the linux-x86_64 primary host** (Phase 6 D-03's deferral condition — "no amd64 dev host" — no longer holds).
- **2026-11-06 host migration**: primary dev host moved darwin-aarch64 → NixOS linux-x86_64; full audit log + clean-clone resumption checklist + case-collision hazard notes live in `.planning/HOSTS.md`. User direction at migration included a possible **x86_64 target pivot** (aarch64 guests are TCG everywhere; x86_64 guests get KVM on the new host) — a milestone-level re-scope conversation pending on the new machine; Phase 10's plans are aarch64-keyed, so the decision should land before Phase 10 execution. **Decided 2026-11-06 at the v2.1 re-scope**: target pivoted to x86_64, v2.0 subsumed (Phases 6–8 delivered, 9–12 inherited re-keyed) — see Current Milestone.
- **Three-track end state (user direction 2026-11-06)**: (1) Harvey runs standalone on its own 9k kernel (kept green throughout); (2) Harvey runs on the r9 kernel (v2.1's proving ground on x86_64 — the point is to functionally flush out r9); (3) ultimately r9 becomes a complete Rust port of Harvey running on its own kernel (future milestone; porting starts only after r9 is proven under the C userspace).
- **riscv64 cautionary tale**: `riscv64/mkfile` references a `jc/jl/ja` toolchain never committed — vaporware scaffolding. Hard rule: toolchain (7l-linked hello-world) lands before any arch dir/mkfile.

## Constraints

- **Tech stack**: Plan 9 C dialect + mk (Harvey userspace); Rust no_std + cargo xtask (r9 kernel, sibling repo `../r9` — phases will work across both repos); host tools must build with plan9port (`$PLAN9/bin` LAST in PATH per BUILD_ON_UNIX)
- **Host platforms**: NixOS **linux-x86_64** is the primary dev machine since 2026-11-06 (see `.planning/HOSTS.md` — migration log + resumption checklist); darwin-aarch64 remains supported (documented-manual venue, lima VM for namespace builds); linux aarch64/x86_64 both supported; Harvey namespace build requires Linux mount namespaces (lima VM on macOS); r9 builds anywhere cargo+qemu run
- **Compatibility**: keep upstream Harvey/Plan 9 conventions (`sys/man/6/style`: tabs, lowercase, `nil`, `exits`/`sysfatal`); r9 follows its own rustfmt.toml
- **Naming**: the 64-bit ARM architecture is `aarch64` (not `arm64`) in this project's tooling and docs
- **Upstream**: dormant; this repo is now the maintained fork — in-tree fixes are preferred over external patch stacks
- **Licenses**: Harvey is MIT since 2021 (GPL only via ghostscript fonts); 9front imports are MIT — compatible

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Nix flake for devshell + build apps | Reproducible toolchain across darwin/linux without Docker-on-EOL-Ubuntu | ✓ Good |
| Vendor 9-cc `iar` subset in-repo (`sys/src/cmd/unix/9cc/`) | External dep kept failing on aarch64 hosts (C23/glibc collisions); in-repo code we control | ✓ Good |
| VM build rsyncs to guest-local disk | virtiofs subdirectory bind-mounts silently return empty trees — namespace build cannot run on the shared mount | ✓ Good |
| Per-OS/arch host bin dirs (`.build/hostbin-<os>-aarch64`) | Host and guest builds share the checkout; binaries must not clobber each other | ✓ Good |
| plan9port `$PLAN9/bin` LAST in PATH | plan9port ships a 9p `mount` that shadows util-linux mount; BUILD_ON_UNIX mandates last | ✓ Good |
| aarch64 (not arm64) naming | User decision 2026-10-30 | ✓ Good |
| Adopt r9 (Rust Plan 9 kernel) as kernel future instead of porting 9k/C to aarch64 | User decision 2026-10-30 — r9 exists (../r9), is the modern path; avoids investing in a C kernel port that would be discarded | ✓ Good |
| r9 gets its own flake; Harvey consumes r9 via flake input | User decision 2026-10-30 — flakes compose via git URLs; relative paths/submodules are fragile glue | ✓ Good (Phase 3: r9 flake.nix landed, R9-05; Harvey-side consumption lands in Phase 5) |
| minimega for VM orchestration, fetched+built by nix (`nix/minimega.nix`, no submodule) | User decision 2026-10-30 — single-binary KVM VM manager with scriptable `.mm` files; upstream is x86/KVM-centric so it covers amd64 test VMs only; aarch64/r9 boots stay on plain qemu | ✓ Good |
| Host-built generators normalize on the awk idiom (`objtype=$cputype mk <tool>.$cputype`) | Phase 1 — deriving tool names from `$cputype`/`$c^c` produced nonexistent `oc`/`ol`; awk's recursion is the proven in-tree pattern | ✓ Good |
| KERNDATE pinned from git commit timestamp, derived host-side, env-overridable | Phase 1 (BUILD-04) — guest rsync excludes `.git`; same-path bit-reproducibility + documented conffile exception | ✓ Good |
| TCG boot capture accepted for BUILD-05 demonstration | Checkpoint 2026-10-31 — dev fleet has no `/dev/kvm`; KVM path documented for any linux x86_64 host | ✓ Good (scoped) |
| Boot-test the toolchain, not just build-test it | Phase 1 — build-green masked LP64 wide-constant truncation in 6c/6l (zaddr/oclass/immconst, NVAR); only a boot attempt exposed the silent corruption | ✓ Good |
| 9k amd64 green before 386/ISO | 9k is the active kernel; limit blast radius of the build-tail milestone | ✓ Good (Phase 1 enforced via `arch=(amd64)` + `WITH_DIST` gate) |
| Vendor-and-own 9front toolchain at a pinned donor SHA, per-dir provenance READMEs (D-10) | Phase 2 — supply-chain discipline is the phase's real security content; one fetch, hard rev-parse gate | ✓ Good |
| Execution-gated ordering: a 7l-linked binary RUNS on the donor kernel before any `aarch64/` scaffolding/CPUS lands | Phase 2 — riscv64 vaporware rule enforced structurally; the gate caught two real bugs (pswt.c LP64 switch sign-extension; memset/memmove n-width) | ✓ Good |
| User-side syscall ABI freeze: `9syscall case aarch64` donor-verbatim + canonical `aarch64/ABI.md` (R0/SP+8/SVC, NMOUNT=54) | Phase 2 (D-15) — r9 Phase 4 consumes this contract; execution-validated before publication | ✓ Good |
| Host nm built against the 9cc-tree libmach, not Harvey's in-tree libmach | Phase 2 — in-tree executable.c hits an LP64-host embedded-typedef dialect wall; 9cc route is the plan's fallback with arm64 support vendored there | ✓ Good (recorded) |
| qemu-11.1.2 donor drift accommodated harness-side only (GIC wake poke, console=0, virtio-non-transitional, ECAM/DTB loader) | Phase 2 (D-12) — donor tree stays pristine; vendor fidelity outranks convenience | ✓ Good |
| libmp `mpvecdigmulsub` split (retire the 2021 PORT rename); member/symbol 1:1 | Phase 2 (02-07) — archive member lookup needs name equality on aarch64 | ✓ Good |
| Default build is dual-arch: `arch=(amd64 aarch64)` with subset-scoped `build_aarch64` | Phase 2 (02-07) — TC-05 acceptance + regression coverage in one `nix run .#build` | ✓ Good |
| Kernel bring-up on qemu `-M virt` shell | Smallest provable target; r9's raspi focus needs a virt platform anyway | ✓ Good (Phase 3: banner + ticks + IRQ echo + panic gate all proven; shell itself is Phase 5) |
| r9 platform tree (riscv64-style `platform/{raspi3b,raspi4b,virt}`, raspi3b default) + trap init/unmask split | Phase 3 (D-01/P5) — virt lands alongside raspi without if/else rot; no IRQ can arrive before a platform arms its handlers | ✓ Good |
| Virt platform as TOML data (xtask `[qemu]` cpu/smp/memory/accel + `[dist]` format; ELF dist skips objcopy/gzip; accel override chain ends at tcg — never hvf default, HVF rejects GICv2 on qemu 11.1.2) | Phase 3 (D-05/D-06/D-07, research P2/P7) — new platforms become data, not Rust edits | ✓ Good |
| Committed DTB artifact (virt-gicv2.dts/.dtb) + ELF-x0=0 → fixed-PA 0x40000000 fallback at both DTB consumers | Phase 3 (P1/P11) — qemu 11.1.2 loads no DTB for ELF kernels without `-dtb`; regeneration procedure documented in the .dts header | ✓ Good |
| Acceptance harness in r9 (`cargo xtask boot-test`, zero-dep unix-socket, marker-only assertions); canonical evidence consolidated in Harvey phase dir | Phase 3 (D-11/D-13) — converts SCs from hand-run observations into a repeatable gate; verifier reproduced both logs byte-for-byte | ✓ Good |
| Accept A/B no-regression evidence for the pre-existing raspi3b/qemu-11.1.2 defect instead of fixing it in 03-03 | User decision 2026-11-01 (decision A) — defect predates the phase; virt never exercises raspi's early-uart path | ✓ Good (scoped; defect tracked as Active follow-up) |
| initrd delivery = qemu generic `-device loader` + host fdtput-patched DTB (D-01 amended) | Phase 4, user decision A 2026-11-02 — Wave-0 spike falsified A3: qemu 11.1.2 never delivers `-initrd` for ELF kernels (hw/arm/boot.c is_linux=0); loader+patched-DTB preserves DTB-mediated delivery with the ELF boot (D-05) intact | ✓ Good (proven end-to-end; kernel /chosen discovery unchanged) |
| Publish TrapFrame≡Ureg as a cross-repo one-way contract (D-05/D-07 confirmed at the publication gate) | Phase 4 — offsets frozen in `aarch64/ABI.md` + pinned by const asserts and xtask ureg-check; an ABI mismatch is a build failure, never a runtime mystery (SC#1) | ✓ Good (negative control fires; live on every boot-test) |
| Tracer-first falsification spikes before machinery (04-01) | Phase 4 — the spike caught the A3 delivery falsification before any kernel capability depended on it; gate splitting (compile-verified machinery 04-04 vs runtime gate 04-05) caught the trap-entry x0 clobber | ✓ Good |
| Implement only the measured syscall set (D-14 trace: pwrite/open/pread/close/exits + named core; loud-unimplemented default) | Phase 4 — no handler without a traced or SC#4-named caller; the first real SVC was pwrite(51), exactly as measured | ✓ Good |
| Exercise IRQ-from-EL0 + return-to-different-process this phase (D-13); invariant `PSTATE.I=0 ⟺ EL0 or stateless sched wfi` | Phase 4 — preemption proven via `sched: switch` markers; exec_bootstrap IRQ-masked after the miniz-inflate heisenbug (contained, root cause deferred #4) | ✓ Good (containment; race follow-up tracked Active) |
| Debug-first Wave 0 before the shell path depends on notes (D-14) | Phase 5 — the note-timeout flake was root-caused (trap_return x9 clobber) and buried BEFORE rc's parser relied on delivery; no unexplained defuses | ✓ Good |
| Measure-first syscall trace of the real boot chain before kernel growth (05-03) | Phase 5 — 26-syscall measured set (16 new vs hello path); caught the brk_ requirement and the namespace re-mount stanza before any device was written | ✓ Good |
| Harvey's flake owns the two-repo composition: inputs.r9 pinned git rev, boot-r9/smoke apps; push-before-pin ordering | Phase 5 (INT-03/INT-04, D-10/D-11) — the pin must name a commit fetchable from a clean clone; relative-path/submodule glue rejected | ✓ Good (hosted CI green on x86_64-linux) |
| CI green = linux leg only (D-13 amendment); darwin leg is documented-manual | Phase 5 — darwin's lima dependency has no hosted runner; the linux leg IS the clean-checkout proof | ✓ Good (run 41825728636) |
| Python harness tools reimplemented as one std-only Rust binary (`build/harness/`) | User decision 2026-11-03 — the repo converges on Rust (r9 kernel); Python host tooling was a stranded dependency | ✓ Good (5/5 equivalence gates; caught a dead Twstat rename + a trace prompt race latent in the .py) |
| Maximal unsafe elimination in r9 with an honesty floor (confined+documented beats wrapped-and-hidden); per-process user-memory model locked | User decision 2026-11-03 — audit surface shrinks to named floor modules; Plan 9's per-process route (TTBR0-live in syscall context) is THE model; no Linux-style copy layer may be introduced | ✓ Good (160-site audit reconciled; all boot gates green) |
| Namespace harness must provide `/bin/rc` (bind `$PLAN9/bin/rc`) — the Dockerfile:42 convention replicated in nsrun.sh | Phase 5 UAT (G-05-1) — the lima VM's undocumented manual /bin/rc masked the gap on every prior leg; first fresh-host run (hosted CI) found it | ✓ Good (byte-identical failure repro → green post-fix) |
| From-scratch virtio transport in r9 port/ (no virtio-drivers crate), zero-offload mask from Day 1, barrier-first ring model host-pinned before any live device | Phase 7 (D-01/D-03/D-04) — the crate's 2025-09 snapshot carried stale assumptions; an unsafe-free, host-testable state machine keeps the device-is-untrusted boundary auditable | ✓ Good (21→54 host pins; the negotiation machine rejected a live device's offered bits correctly on first bind) |
| Test delivery, not just counters (gates must read a data file, not only stats/pcap) | Phase 7 UAT (G-07-1) — every automated gate stayed green while inbound frames were counted-but-never-enqueued (RX slice off by VIRTIO_NET_HDR_LEN on two-descriptor chains); only a conversational UAT blocked-read caught it | ✓ Good (two-round diagnosis: protocol lifetime bug, then the real kernel offset bug; chain-faithful pin now covers the Ring↔drain seam) |
| Tier allowlists are committed DATA + append-only; artifact+execution markers are the only gates (mk exit status never trusted) | Phase 6 (D-13/USPACE-04) — allowlist growth is a reviewable diff, never a flag-flip; plan9port mk aborts at first failing recipe and BUILD swallows statuses, so truth lives in committed ledgers | ✓ Good (tier-0/1 green donor→r9→9k; classify-only teeth proven on doctored logs) |
| x86_64 CI donor evidence comes from Harvey's OWN kernel (k10t1 venue), 9front retired to aarch64-local donor only | User decision 2026-11-05 (G-06-1/CR-01) — 9front was the donor only because Harvey lacked local aarch64; on amd64 CI the evidence now comes from 9k10cpu lineage, and the retirement is CI-asserted (venue-pin step), not prose | ✓ Good (k10t1 standalone green; phase6.yml four legs hosted-green; CR-01 resolved by retirement) |
| Venue honesty over verdict shape: named T1-SKIP lines, never an unearned T1-OK; evidence names its venue | Phase 6 (06-09) — the embedded-root venue cannot run write-flow/selfhost entries, so it says so in the log instead of masquerading as full-boot equivalence | ✓ Good (36 OK + 24 SKIP census; SKIP-whitelist converse assert blocks vocabulary drift) |
| smoltcp 0.14 behind the devip ABI as r9's TCP/IP engine; the contract doc is the executable spec | Phase 8 (D-01..D-04, NETIP-01) — the file tree IS the contract: gates assert the doc, man-vs-source divergences flagged in it, and the supply chain is crates.io pin + committed lockfile with a joint same-axis provenance record | ✓ Good (36/36 must-haves; OQ-1 DHCP-fidelity resolved empirically PASS-path — no wire shim, smoltcp dhcpv4 socket never wired) |
| Event-driven devip↔smoltcp seam with NO periodic polling (BusyCell single ownership, NET_DEADLINE armed from poll_at, STACK_DEBT drain) | Phase 8 (D-05) — the seam has no polling cadence to save it from a missed waker, so the whole mapping is pinned host-side before any guest gate depends on it | ✓ Good (152-pin port suite + all guest gates green; the wakeup-loss class was gate-caught once and fixed by re-probe-after-drive) |
| Implement RFMEM in r9 at the moment the tracer surfaces the gap (donor dupseg + growth families + refcount-gated free) | Phase 8 08-04 blocking-human checkpoint, user decision A conditioned on Harvey fidelity (verified: ip/ping.c:572 RFMEM is Harvey-native, not a 9front artifact) — tracer-first doctrine pays foundational gaps when surfaced, not later | ✓ Good (ping/udp/tcp gates green; the checkpoint's "no post-fork brk_ growth" premise was falsified at the gate and the full donor growth semantics landed) |
| Pivot target aarch64 → x86_64 at v2.1, subsuming v2.0 (Phases 6–8 delivered; 9–12 inherited re-keyed) | User decision 2026-11-06 — amd64 userspace+toolchain already green in-tree, r9 `port/` is arch-neutral, KVM-native gates on the linux-x86_64 host; aarch64 frozen at its green pin | — Pending |
| Three-track end state: Harvey-on-9k standalone ∥ Harvey-on-r9 → r9 as a complete Rust port of Harvey | User direction 2026-11-06 — Harvey-on-r9 is the r9 flush-out vehicle; the Rust port follows only after r9 is proven on x86_64 | — Pending |

## Evolution

This document evolves at phase transitions and milestone boundaries.

**After each phase transition** (via `/gsd-transition`):
1. Requirements invalidated? → Move to Out of Scope with reason
2. Requirements validated? → Move to Validated with phase reference
3. New requirements emerged? → Add to Active
4. Decisions to log? → Add to Key Decisions
5. "What This Is" still accurate? → Update if drifted

**After each milestone** (via `/gsd-complete-milestone`):
1. Full review of all sections
2. Core Value check — still the right priority?
3. Audit Out of Scope — reasons still valid?
4. Update Context with current state
